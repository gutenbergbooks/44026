<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2><!--TN: added period-->


<p>The work to which these few lines are meant to form a
preface does not aspire to the dignity of containing anything
resembling an exhaustive treatise on each, or any
of the numerous minor subjects connected with the
principal one of Equitation. It is simply a collection of
useful and practical hints on matters that pertain to the
horse and his management—no study of things abstruse
being brought into requisition, or any complicated theories
put forward for guidance. The instructions given are of the
plainest and easiest description, and are the result of an
experience which has in some instances been rather dearly
bought; the experiments described have been duly tested,
the recipes tried, the systems explored, and the rules set
forth rigidly investigated before being recommended.</p>

<p>The unexpected success which attended the publication
of “Ladies on Horseback” induced the Messrs. Ingram,
proprietors of the <cite>Lady’s Pictorial</cite>, to commission me, some
little time ago, to write for them a set of articles of a
<a id="Page_xii" href="#Page_xii" class="pagenum" title="xii"> </a>
prepared in part from very rough sketches made by my
own hand, I think I shall have said enough to form a
suitable “preliminary canter” to this volume, and may
prepare to go up to the starting-point, and begin my race.</p>

<div class="figleft w350">
  <img src="images/illus-001.jpg" width="332" height="400" alt="The Common Sense of Riding" />
</div>


<p>The “Common
Sense of Riding,”
which formed the
title under which
these writings
were first furnished
to the public
in the columns
of a London
journal, supplied
a fitting heading for
the articles at the
time, very little concerning
stable or
general horse management
being appended
to the instructions offered to equestrians. The
expediency of adding to the work formed a necessity for
altering the title; but the original one, if used here, would
<a id="Page_2" href="#Page_2" class="pagenum" title="2"> </a>
set forth precisely the manner in which I am about to deal
with the subject that I have taken in hand.</p>

<p>To discard preamble, and plunge at once <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in medias res</i>,
is usually the wisest and most common-sense manner of
coming at and coping with the difficulties surrounding
crotchety questions: and surely one of the foremost in the
category of such is the often-heard inquiry, “How shall I
best learn to ride?”</p>

<p>To offer instruction on any subject to persons who fancy
they have no need of it, is at all times mere waste of time
and trouble. My remarks, therefore—embracing, as it is
meant they shall, a variety of matters especially interesting
to ladies—will be addressed throughout to those only who
really feel their need of friendly counsel, who are <em>anxious</em>
to learn, and are willing to benefit by such hints and
instructions as my varied experiences of horses and horse-management
enable me to give them.</p>

<p>Before entering fully upon my pleasant task, I would
say that although many men, and very many youths, may
learn a useful lesson or two from matters upon which I
shall touch, or possibly deal with in detail, my observations
will be directed chiefly to <em>ladies</em>, my desire being to take
each separately, as it were, into my confidence, and speak
to her less as teacher to pupil than as friend to friend.</p>

<p>It seems to me that to adopt the homely pronouns
“you” and “I” will be more convenient and concise
than adhering to the stereotyped and old-fashioned terms
“the reader,” and “the author”—modes of expression
which are as a rule unnecessarily formal, and most uncomfortably
<a id="Page_3" href="#Page_3" class="pagenum" title="3"> </a>
cold. When, therefore, I begin my subject, I
shall suppose that you are a novice, with but a very shadowy
idea of the subject on which you wish to be enlightened;
but when I say “novice,” I do not necessarily mean a child.
Indeed, I hope that you are not one, for it is widely known
that I object very strongly to children riding, my reasons
for doing so being founded on the surest and most
common-sense principles. The point is one which has of
late years led me into discussions with very many high-class
authorities on equitation, but I have never for a
moment swerved from my fixed opinions, and many of my
keenest opponents have, from time to time, ranged themselves
on my side.</p>

<p>It is indeed a matter of surprise to me that anybody
possessed of even moderate reasoning capacity can
advocate infantile equestrianism. The two arguments
which defenders of it make their strong points, namely,
that it is “splendid exercise,” and that it imparts a courage
which is beneficial in after life, can, while admitted, be
counterbalanced by so many genuine drawbacks and
objections, that their boasted efficacy runs considerable risk
of being regarded as a thing of nought. Before, however,
dealing with the <em>con’s</em> of the case, let us take up the <em>pro’s</em> in
rotation. It is splendid exercise. Granted; but rolling
hoop is quite as good, while ball-playing, tennis, badminton,
and every other game that sets the blood in motion and
calls the muscles into active play, may be styled equally
beneficial. All the advantages which are derivable from
exercise—and they are many—can be had without riding;
<a id="Page_4" href="#Page_4" class="pagenum" title="4"> </a>
this is an admitted fact; and, being so, it serves to sweep
away suppositious inferences respecting the superiority of
<i>equine</i> practice, or training, over that of any other sort. So
much for the oft-quoted plea of “exercise.”</p>

<p>With regard to the question of courage, it cannot be
denied that a certain and useful amount of <em>confidence</em> is
imparted to all young persons who participate largely in
pursuits which have a smack of daring or danger about
them. Watch, for example, the peasant girls who inhabit
the country districts of Ireland. They climb steep
mountains, descend jagged cliffs, run barefooted along
sharp ledges and high rugged walls, without thought of
danger, or trace of fear. And why? Because from childhood
they have been accustomed to it. It goes, then,
without saying that early practice does impart an amount
of bravado, which may in later life be found useful on
occasion; but, having acknowledged this, I feel that I have
done my entire duty towards the advocates of a system to
which I strongly object, and I shall, therefore, proceed, in
all fairness, to demolish their theories by a clear and
simple setting forth of the evils which are, in my opinion,
attendant upon early equestrian pursuits.</p>

<p>Few persons will be found to dispute the fact that a
child on horseback, especially a girl, runs at least as many
risks as a grown person. She may at any moment be
jerked off, run away with, overpowered by the strength
or temper of her mount, cannoned against by awkward
or reckless riders, or subjected to the unpleasantness of
discovering that the animal she herself is riding is given
<a id="Page_5" href="#Page_5" class="pagenum" title="5"> </a>
to slipping, stumbling, falling completely under her, or
behaving in some unseemly manner that is entirely beyond
her powers to check or control. To these dangers and
discomforts—as well as to many others with which equestrians,
old and young, are uncomfortably familiar—she is at
all times liable to be exposed, and, this being an admitted
truth, I ask whether it can for a moment be asserted that a
child is as capable as an adult of coping with such risks?
The answer <em>must</em> be “No.” The perils are the same for
both—while the weaker side is absolutely unable to
grapple with them when they arise. I speak from experience,
and strive to teach from it also. Having been
largely associated with juvenile riders, especially in country
parts of England, the knowledge which I have picked up
from <em>their</em> absolute want of it has proved most fitting and
serviceable to me when offering hints and instructions to
others of similar age. Five years ago I had the unhappiness
of seeing a pretty child who was riding with me
seriously hurt, through her horse falling under her while
traversing an extremely rutty road. He made what is
called a double stumble, and had her hands possessed the
cunning, or her arms the strength, to have pulled him
together after he had made the first blunder, he would
undoubtedly not have gone down; but he was a slovenly
animal,—one that wanted “collecting” and keeping well
in hand: two things of which my tender little companion
knew nothing whatever; nor was she capable of putting
them in practice, even had it been otherwise.</p>

<p>About the same time I saw another bright-eyed little
<a id="Page_6" href="#Page_6" class="pagenum" title="6"> </a>
maiden run away with over the “breezy downs.” Her
horse, fresh and frolicsome, started with mine at a light
canter, and for awhile we kept nicely together; but
presently—after a quarter of a mile or so—her mount
began to romp with his head, and finally breaking into a
gallop, made off at terrific speed, lashing the damp turf
from beneath his flying hoofs, and laying back his wicked
ears until they rested flat upon his neck. I knew that the
youngster he was carrying had abundance of pluck, even
without any very distinct knowledge of the art of riding, so
I shouted to her with all my might to sit close and leave
him his head (we were going up hill at the time), and to
give him the whip when he tired, which I knew he very
soon would do, with a long, heavy incline in front of him.
I might as well have spoken to the wind. Terror, and
consciousness of her own ignorance robbed the child of
her wits: she gripped the pommel with her right hand,
tugged at the reins with her left, and, after swaying about
in a manner that makes me sick to think of, finally fell off,
and was picked up bruised and bleeding, and so entirely
unnerved as to render it a matter of extreme difficulty to
persuade her ever to ride again. As for the horse, he was
not personally any the worse of his escapade, but, having
conquered his rider, he was ever afterwards rightfully
considered an unsafe animal for a lady to mount.</p>

<p>I have seen children over and over again subjected to
the most fearful risks through riding horses that were too
much for them. It is so easy for a girl to be overpowered,—and,
once she is so, good-bye for ever to all or any pleasure
<a id="Page_7" href="#Page_7" class="pagenum" title="7"> </a>
in riding the animal who has been her conqueror. He will
always remember his victory, and presume upon it.</p>

<p>Horses are not simpletons; their wisdom, on the contrary,
is astonishing. Allow them to vanquish you once,
and they will pursue their advantage to their lives’ end.</p>

<p>There are other reasons, also, on which I ground my
objections to children riding. Little girls are exceedingly
apt to grow crooked. It is all sheer nonsense to say
“they will not if they <em>sit straight</em>,” inasmuch as young
riders never do, as a rule, fall into the desired method; or,
if for awhile it is a thing accomplished, they very speedily
fall out of it again, when fatigue overpowers them, or the
groom has shortened their stirrup-leather too much, or when
a large amount of pressure upon it during a long ride has
stretched it to an uncomfortable length. It is the merest
sophistry to argue that such things <em>ought</em> not to occur,
seeing that they do, and are in fact happening every day
around us. One child out of five hundred may, perhaps,
be an habitual straight-sitter, but to counterbalance her
perfection in this particular, the remaining 499 will
be either hanging to one side or the other (usually the
near, or left side), or sitting square enough, it may be,
yet with the right shoulder thrust forward and upward,
thus sowing the seeds of a deformity which in ten years’
time, when the little one of eight shall have grown into a
belle of eighteen, will have become an incurable disfigurement,
one which all the arts of the most skilful <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">modiste</i>
cannot by any possibility cover, or the most seraphic
charms of face and manner serve to put out of sight.</p>
<a id="Page_8" href="#Page_8" class="pagenum" title="8"> </a>

<p>The frame of a child, even the most robust, is too weakly
and delicate—too liable to grow “out of form”—to render
equestrian exercise a fitting pursuit for persons of tender
age. Nature has not ruled that her frail handiwork shall be
roughly or unfairly strained, and when it is, the penalty is
certain to follow, in disarranged system, weakened or injured
muscular development, misplaced shoulder-blades, undue
tension of the tendons of the left leg—or contraction of them,
which is worse—accompanied by an unnatural languor
and a constant craving for permission “to go and lie down,”
which, in so many cases, children are observed to manifest.</p>

<p>The absurd assertion that no girl can excel as a horsewoman
unless she begins to practise the art when a child
has been so often and substantially refuted that to attempt
further contradiction of it would be merely to entail loss of
time. Suffice it to say that some of the finest equestrians
the world has ever produced have been entirely ignorant of
riding until after their arrival at womanhood, or, at all
events, until childish days had been left far in the rear.
Of these a foreign Empress is a noteworthy example, while
many others, whose names in park and hunting-field are
familiar as household words, might go to swell the list.</p>

<p>“Well, but really”—I fancy I hear some unconvinced
matron saying—“I cannot see that my children are anything
the worse for riding every day. I myself rode
when I was their age, and it never seemed to do me
any harm.” Granted, madam; but question yourself,
whether you have a right, because <em>you</em> have had the good
fortune to escape the evils usually consequent upon a
<a id="Page_9" href="#Page_9" class="pagenum" title="9"> </a>
prejudicial system, to encourage your offspring to go in the
way of contracting them. As well might you boast of
having escaped contagion during an attendance on a fever
patient, and then (presuming on your own lucky chance)
thrust your children deliberately into an infected house.
No; if you are a wise parent, or guardian, advocate
early instruction in pianoforte-playing and its study,
also in drawing, painting, and such branches of education
as will expand and benefit the understanding, without
unduly straining the yet undeveloped resources of
the body; encourage likewise such exercises as are of a
healthful and suitable nature—but compel the young folks
of whom you have charge to leave riding alone, at all
events until the fourteenth year has been well got over:
because, just as in singing the vocal organs are weak, and
the voice apt to alter and break about that period (which
is the case with girls as with boys, although very many
fail to know or believe it), so, in like manner, the
frame of a young girl is delicate and unstrung, and is
absolutely <em>incapable</em> of enduring strain or fatigue without
incurring consequences which, even if not made much
account of at the time, will most likely in after life cause
themselves to be dismally felt.</p>

<p>About fifteen, or from that to twenty, is an excellent
time for a girl to learn to ride—by which I mean that she
ought not to attempt it before the first-mentioned age
while the last will not be one whit too late. Boys may
begin whenever they choose; their position on horseback
obviates the possibility of growing shoulder-crooked, while
<a id="Page_10" href="#Page_10" class="pagenum" title="10"> </a>
custom which enables them to ride with a leg on each
side of the saddle, equalises their seat, and fairly distributes
the amount of <em>stress</em> which pressure on the
stirrups entails upon both nether limbs. Moreover, they
are infinitely stronger, even from babyhood—can bear
any amount of knocking about, and so far from being
injured by an occasional spill or two, are immensely
benefited by making moderate acquaintance with mother
earth. It is not so with girls, and around them all my
sympathies entwine.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

<span class="chapter-title">FOR MOTHERS AND CHILDREN.</span></h2>


<p>It is a rare thing to take up a cookery book in which the
reader is not solemnly warned against the evils attendant
upon frying chops and steaks in the pan, the deterrent
paragraph usually winding up with: “Nevertheless, for the
benefit of those who will not be brought to acknowledge
the superiority of the gridiron as a cooking utensil, we
append a few instructions.” It is as though the writer of
the volume meant solemnly to say, “I have told you how
to avoid the horrors of dyspepsia; but, if you <em>will</em> go in for
them, I may as well show you the least objectionable way
of doing it.”</p>

<p>On this principle, or something bearing a close resemblance
to it, I have, as in duty bound, made known my
objections to girls of immature age being permitted to
indulge in equestrian exercise; and having eased my
conscience by doing so, I shall lay down a few rules for the
guidance of those who pay no heed to friendly warnings,
but prefer taking their own way, and who, in short, <em>will</em>
have the pan, in preference to the gridiron.</p>

<p>First, then, I will surmise that the child to be instructed
is at least five years old. There are, I am aware, mothers
<a id="Page_12" href="#Page_12" class="pagenum" title="12"> </a>
of families who actually put their infant children into
panniers, because they “look pretty” in them, and send
them out on ponies for an hour’s jolting, with their poor
little heads bobbing pitifully about, and brain and spine
alike suffering from the so-called exercise. There are
fathers, too, who think that their boys ought to ride before
they are well capable of walking, and who in consequence
of this belief clap them on to wide-backed, rough-actioned
animals, regardless of the dangers to which, by so doing, they
are exposing the feeble frames of their hapless offspring. To
aid such persons by offering any sort of instruction as a help
to their objectionable practices would be like assisting at a
murder, or showing a torturer how to get on with his work.</p>

<p>I was choosing some articles at the establishment of a
fashionable saddler a short time ago, when the proprietor
stepped forward and requested me to look at an instrument
(I can call it by no other name) which he had just
completed to order. It was a child’s saddle, with a contrivance
not unlike a brazier, arising from the centre of it,
well furnished with padding and straps. This unique
appliance was, it appeared, the invention of the father of
the unfortunate infant for whose benefit it had been manufactured,
and his pride in its appearance, and in his own
cleverness, was quite unbounded. Determined that his
son, aged three, should begin his lessons in horsemanship
at that early period of life, and resolved to secure him from
tumbling off (the only thing in the shape of danger to
which he gave a moment’s thought), he conceived the
idea of buckling the infant into the “brazier,” which was
<a id="Page_13" href="#Page_13" class="pagenum" title="13"> </a>
meant to come right up under the armpits, and by this
means avert all possibility of a fall. It had apparently
never struck this intelligent inventor of curiosities that the
<em>pony</em> might fall as well as the boy, and that if it did, the
little rider could scarcely fail to be seriously if not fatally
injured, owing to the impossibility of his falling clear of the
prostrate animal.</p>

<p>If a child of tender years <em>must</em> ride, by order of an ill-judging
parent or caretaker, let it do so upon a safety-pad,
fitted with a well-stuffed back, in order to prevent that of
the child from becoming fatigued by remaining too long
unsupported.</p>

<p>The pad-pony should be a light, elastic walker, and of
necessity perfectly docile and quiet. He must, of course,
be led: his paces being properly regulated, and his head
kept quite straight. A good contrivance for this—and
indeed for leading any description of horse—is a stout
bamboo cane, fitted with a swivel snaphook.</p>

<p>The pad-pony should be ridden with a mild snaffle
bridle, with loops somewhat large—and I am a great
advocate for <i>flap-reins</i>: by which I mean a straight but not
over-tightened band, extending from the flap of the saddle
to the loop or ring of the bit, on either side—an admirable
contrivance, which keeps the pony’s head in position, and
also serves as a check against restiveness or starting. The
girths should be broad and strong, and not too slack, and
the pad should be made without a tree, and be composed of
some soft roughened material, ornamented or not—according
to fancy, and the outlay to be involved in the matter.</p>
<a id="Page_14" href="#Page_14" class="pagenum" title="14"> </a>

<p>The advantage of having a strap in front is apparent for
a very young child. It should, however, be used <em>only</em>
when the pony is led, and when he cannot therefore
possibly make off or fall down. In such case, and such
only, it may be approved, inasmuch as it imparts a certain
amount of confidence to an infant learner, and is likewise
of assistance in ensuring an upright seat; but I should like
to see it discontinued after the first few lessons, and the
back of the pad also removed when a trifle more experience
has been gained.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

  <div class="caption"><p>PONY WITH FLAP-REINS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>About eight years old is the very earliest age at which a
<a id="Page_15" href="#Page_15" class="pagenum" title="15"> </a>
girl should, under any circumstances, be permitted to ride
on a side-saddle, or to mount the back of an unled animal.
I prefer a small horse to a pony for the initiatory lessons,
as being generally better paced and better broken. The
child should not at first be allowed to touch the bridle at
all. She should sit perfectly square and erect, her figure
well balanced, her shoulders thrown back, and her arms
folded upon her breast, while an attendant walks alongside
her horse and keeps his paces evenly regulated. This is
the correct method of teaching a child how to ride <em>from
balance</em>,—an accomplishment most desirable for every class
of rider. The ordinary fashion of putting a little one up,
and giving her the reins to hold on by, is about as efficient
a plan of instruction as teaching the same child to play the
piano by ear only—thus ignoring the very first principles
of the art—or running-up a building without laying a
foundation-stone. Circus-children, the most beautiful
balance-riders in the world, are taught to ride at first
without ever touching the reins; and nothing else that
could be suggested would ever be capable of giving the
same firmness of seat.</p>

<p>If the learner be a boy, he should be taught his first
lessons without stirrups; but I would not deny the assistance
of such support to a little girl, as her position on the
saddle would otherwise entail much extra fatigue upon
the left leg. Be it understood, however, that the stirrup
should be taken away after the first few lessons, and the
child be instructed to ride for at least an hour a day without
any such aid; otherwise she will trust to it, when riding,
<a id="Page_16" href="#Page_16" class="pagenum" title="16"> </a>
for the remainder of her life, and to ride <em>from</em> the stirrup is
one of the most objectionable practices into which a young
person can possibly fall.</p>

<p>When a firm and even seat has been obtained, without
the help of reins or stirrup, the former (of the very lightest
description, and <em>single</em>) may be entrusted to the little
learner’s hands, but the flap-reins must not by any means
be discarded.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus-016.jpg" width="400" height="372" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>YOUNG CHILD’S SADDLE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>When the child is perfectly at home on her horse, and
has learned to treat his mouth with the utmost gentleness,
<a id="Page_17" href="#Page_17" class="pagenum" title="17"> </a>
and not on any account to pull at the bridle, a canter may
be indulged in, by the attendant attaching a long rein to a
cavesson and urging the horse to a gentle pace, making
him lead <em>always</em> with the right leg, and pulling him up
directly he changes to the left. The child should be most
carefully watched during the exercise, and any tendency
to hang over on one side or the other, or to lift one
shoulder, or poke the neck, be at once checked.</p>

<p>The saddle should be level-seated—covered with buckskin,
for a beginner—and should have no off-pommel. This
latter appendage is happily almost obsolete, except with
the most old-fashioned saddles, and is entirely unnecessary,
as well as unsightly, for it affords no additional safety to the
rider, and youthful learners are especially apt to lay hold
upon it in any imaginary danger—an excessively bad
practice to acquire.</p>

<p>As the term “level seat” applied to side saddles may
not be generally understood, I will give a few words of
explanation:—The ordinary side saddle, being made with
the arch of the tree raised to clear the withers, is necessarily
much higher in front than behind, and as a consequence
the knee is thrown up in a cramped and fatiguing position;
it is difficult thus to keep the figure erect, an aching back
ensues to the rider, and frequently torture to the horse.
The level-seated saddle has the steel front-part cut quite
away over the withers, and replaced by a pad of soft
leather, giving that horizontal shape from front to rear so
much desired, yet so seldom found. These saddles were
introduced and perfected by Messrs. Nicholls and Co., of
<a id="Page_18" href="#Page_18" class="pagenum" title="18"> </a>
2, Jermyn Street, London, who have carefully studied the
comfort of both horse and rider, and assisted by the experience
and suggestions of that well-known authority,
Mr. Wilson of Albington Manor, late master of the Vale of
White Horse Hounds, have produced really admirable side
saddles.</p>

<p>Trotting must be taught when the pupil has been perfected
in the canter. It is not an easy thing either to teach
or learn, but I shall come at the principles of it by-and-by.
Trotting should be practised on soft, springy ground,
never on a road, and the horse on which the lessons are
taken should be very light of action, and of <em>even paces</em>.
Otherwise, the punishment to the learner will be great, and
the teacher’s difficulties equally trying.</p>

<p>Little girls learning to ride should be dressed in neat
skirts, just long enough to cover the feet; loose-fitting
jackets—(jerseys are excellent)—hair left flowing, never
fastened up; and soft hats or caps, <em>well</em> secured under the
chin, in such a manner as to prevent the possibility of their
coming off. Whips should not on any account be allowed
until some degree of proficiency has been attained, and the
proper use of them should then be strictly pointed out, and
as strictly adhered to. With this matter I shall likewise
hereafter deal, as also with the question of spurs—articles
which, I may here observe, should never, under <em>any</em> pretext
whatever, be granted for children’s use.</p>

<p>A child should be taught to mount her horse with ease
when assisted, as also the expediency of being able to do
so without any help at all: this latter by simply letting
<a id="Page_19" href="#Page_19" class="pagenum" title="19"> </a>
down the stirrup-leather—taking it up, of course, to the
required length, or rather shortness, when seated securely
on the saddle. She should likewise practice dismounting
without assistance. No active child should ever think of
requiring a helping hand. To lift the right leg deftly over
the up-crutch, take the left foot from the stirrup, gather
the skirt well together with the right hand—making certain
that no portion of it is in any way caught upon the pommels—and
then to jump lightly down, is the proper method of
dismounting. To be lifted—except for very young pupils—is
extremely babyish.</p>

<p>How long a child should be permitted to ride at a
stretch is a question very often asked me, and one to
which I find some difficulty in giving a satisfactory reply.
Some children are strong, and can both endure and enjoy
an amount of exercise that would knock a delicate child
completely up. Again, some are passionately fond of the
art, while others care but little about it, and (as is well
known) the things that one likes are seldom liable to
cause fatigue, except when carried beyond the ordinary
limits of moderation.</p>

<p>The counsel I would give is this: Watch carefully for
any sign of lassitude, or display of weariness on the part of
the pupil, and stop the riding as soon as such appears.
What I mean to convey is, that if a child complains of
feeling tired during her lesson, she should at once be
permitted to dismount; or if after, say, an hour’s ride on
the road she is conscious of fatigue, the time should on the
next occasion be shortened to three-quarters, or even to
<a id="Page_20" href="#Page_20" class="pagenum" title="20"> </a>
half, and subsequently increased, according as the pupil
gains experience and strength.</p>

<p>Nothing should be left undone to inspire confidence in
the breast of a child-rider. Her mount should be the
gentlest, her teacher the kindest, all her appliances (saddle,
&amp;c.) new, comfortable, and reliable. Girths that are apt to
break, for instance, give a child uncomfortable impressions,—and
early ideas or opinions on <em>any</em> subject are certain to
influence the entire of the later life. Be it remembered,
however, that although everything should be done to make
the youthful learner feel at ease, while striving at the same
time to impart proficiency, no approach to self-conceit, or
desire to “show off,” should be for an instant encouraged.
Modesty of demeanour is quite as charming out of doors
as within. The child who pays attention to her seat, her
hands, her horse—in short, to what she is doing—will make
a better and more reliable horsewoman (even though she
may be awkward at first) than will she who looks about for
admiration, while neglecting the principles on which she
has been taught. It is like the plodding student and the
flippant-tongued. One will answer every question with
tolerable smartness, out of the shallow depths of a superficial
knowledge, while the other, though missing, may nevertheless
be engaged in laying up a store of learning, which
will in after life stand her in good stead.</p>

<p>Now, a word specially addressed to children, and I shall
close my chapter. Be uniformly kind to animals, especially
to the horses that carry you. Let humanity be a portion
of your religion. Discipline, properly exercised, is just
<a id="Page_21" href="#Page_21" class="pagenum" title="21"> </a>
and right, and is as far removed from <em>cruelty</em> as is light
from darkness, or bitter from sweet; but, hand in hand
with it, <em>gentleness</em> should ever go. A hasty temper will
induce cutting with the whip, dragging with the bridle,
kicking or rasping with the heel, and uttering rough words,
which, although not thoroughly understood by the animal,
yet carry a tone with them which has a meaning for him of
no pleasurable sort. On the other hand, a child of cold and
dogged disposition will take its turn out of the willing slave
at its command, and think no more about it than if it were
a mere machine. This is pitiably wrong. You, <em>as</em> a child,
ought to teach your horses to love you. You <em>can</em> do so, and
it is well worth the time employed in the pursuit. I need
not tell you how to do it: instinct will teach you. There
are a thousand little ways and means, all of which you can
try. For instance, always pet your horse in his stall, and
when saddled for your use; make much of him when you
are on his back, patting his neck, and stroking him gently
with your hand, speaking soothingly to him all the while.
Accustom him to the sound of your voice; give him scraps
of bread, sugar, apple, or carrot when you dismount, or
while he waits for you at the door; and when you do this,
allow him to take the morsel quietly off the palm of your
hand, not showing any fear; he will not bite you, if he is fit
to be your pet. You should never offer him a bit between
your fingers, or pull your hand away before he has taken
the morsel up. This will, or at least <em>may</em>, induce him to
snap: just as it would provoke a dog to do, if tantalised.
You can feed him, too, if you like, when seated on his back;
<a id="Page_22" href="#Page_22" class="pagenum" title="22"> </a>
there is nothing more charming than sympathy between
the human and the brute creation. Horse and rider should
be on the best of terms, and all will then go right.</p>

<p>In a former work of mine on equitation, I made repeated
mention of a hunter I once possessed, called “Pleader.” I
gave him that name because his sire was “The Lawyer,” a
very famous horse. “Pleader” and his mistress were on
the most affectionate terms—brother and sister we were,
that horse and I; certainly no two ever loved one another
better—and this despite the fact that I had given him
many a good whipping, for I trained him myself, and he
was a rare hard one to bring to his manners; but he knew
quite as well as I did that it was for his good, and so he
loved me none the less. I rode him subsequently to
hounds for three seasons, without ever giving him so much
as a warning touch. When we fell together—and how often
we did!—he waited for me to get up; and when he was
the first on his legs, although trembling with excitement
to scurry away with the rest, he would stand patiently
for me to remount him. That horse’s training was not
thrown away. He carried me in the first flight through
two long and trying runs, the very day previous to that on
which I met the accident that deprived me of the power
of ever riding him again, and he is now carrying in similar
splendid style a noble and popular master of hounds, the
Earl of Eglinton and Winton, gaining honourable mention
in the <cite>Field</cite> and other sporting papers. I sold him to a
good master and a good home, and when he shall have
finished his work (if I am spared to see it) he has been
<a id="Page_23" href="#Page_23" class="pagenum" title="23"> </a>
promised to me again, that the last of his days may be
spent in quiet happy idleness, and that the hands that
trained him may lay him to his rest.</p>

<p>I have spoken thus of “Pleader,” not altogether because I
love him so dearly, as to encourage my young readers
to make much of the animals that carry them, and to
establish a bond of <em>mutual sympathy</em>, which is as beautiful
as it is good. The greatest horsewoman in the world, Her
Imperial Majesty the Empress of Austria, frequently feeds

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

<span class="chapter-title">FIRST HINTS TO A LEARNER.</span></h2>


<p>Having already pointed out my objections to children’s
riding, and appended a chapter of instructions for the
benefit of those whose prejudices in favour of it will not be
overruled, I shall in the present one assume that you, my
reader, are not a child in years, although you may be one in
experience. Surmising, then, that I am addressing a young
lady of sixteen, or thereabouts—although the fact of your
being much older will not in any way tell against you—the
first point for consideration will be, whether you are
resident in town or country. If the former, or that you
even come up for a temporary visit now and again, the
wisest counsel that I can give you will be to place yourself
under the care of the very best riding-master within
reach of you, being careful to select one according to reliable
recommendation, for some are as incompetent as others are
the reverse. I shall not occupy space or provoke jealousies
by naming any in particular, but shall here take occasion
to say, that readers desirous of receiving private hints or
information on any subject strictly connected with horses,
riding, or stable-management, can receive such by addressing
their inquiries to me, care of my publishers, by whom all
<a id="Page_25" href="#Page_25" class="pagenum" title="25"> </a>
communications will be at once sent forward. This plan I
have found to work very well upon former occasions, a few
rules being of necessity laid down. For example: ask
all questions as briefly as possible; write clearly; do
not cross your letters; and wait patiently for answers,
accepting the assurance that no unnecessary delay will be
made.</p>

<p>Having, then, advised you, if a city belle, to secure the
services of a competent riding-master (though it shall be
my aim by-and-by to teach you how to ride very well
without one), I would follow up this counsel by saying,
when you do so, leave yourself entirely in his hands, and
do precisely what he tells you. This is not by any
means an unnecessary admonition, for at least one-half the
awkward riders whose deficiencies pain our critical eyes
in the Row and elsewhere, have learned in good schools,
but have been too wilful, or too conceited, to give up their
own entirely erroneous ideas on certain subjects connected
with equitation, and, as a consequence, failure—not to say
fiasco—has of course followed.</p>

<p>It is precisely the same with regard to every other art.
The pupil should submit her own opinions to those of her
teacher. If he is not competent to instruct her, why go
to him at all? And, on the other hand, if he is, why not
follow his advice?</p>

<p>To illustrate my meaning: I rode with a girl, one day,
to a meet of hounds at Courtown Gate—starting from
Kilcock Station, to which point we had railed our horses
from Dublin, and trotting the two miles, or thereabouts, at
<a id="Page_26" href="#Page_26" class="pagenum" title="26"> </a>
a brisk pace, for we were a trifle behind time. From the
moment that we settled in our saddles, until we saw the
tails of the “beauties” in full wag at the entrance to Capt.
Davis’s demesne, that girl never for an instant removed her
left hand from her thigh—(pardon plain speaking; it was
neither on her hip nor her knee that she placed it when
we started), the fingers pointing in the direction of the up-pommel,
causing, of course, the elbow to be shot out entirely
from the side, the joint turning outwards in singularly ugly
fashion. Should any of my readers have a desire to picture
to themselves this position, with more clearness than words—or
lack of them—have enabled me to depict it, they
have only to seat themselves for a moment upon a make-believe
horse, and adopt the pose which I have just described.
I wish they <em>would</em> do it; it would be an excellent
future warning. As I had a tolerably close acquaintance
with the young lady—who had, I was aware, been taught
by a really first-rate master—I ventured upon asking her
whether the peculiarity on which she seemed to pride herself
had met with his approval?</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, no!” she replied. “Old <i>Prosey</i> liked me to
put both hands to the bridle, or if only one, the left; but I
like this style myself; it’s so <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chic</i>!”</p>

<p>I was not her teacher, nor did she inquire my opinion,—in
fact she would in all probability have dubbed <em>me</em> “Old
Prosey” also, had I offered one; so I wisely kept silent—and
no doubt my companion believed that I was admiring
her original attitude very much, for she rather intensified it
as we proceeded, and took care to canter <em>in advance</em> of me,
<a id="Page_27" href="#Page_27" class="pagenum" title="27"> </a>
whenever we came to a patch of grass by the roadside, as
though to give me full opportunity for feasting my eyes
upon her figure.</p>

<p>Ah me! How often have I seen the same thing since
that well-remembered day; seen it—been sorry for it—and
yet smiled to myself because of the vanity and the
folly. Would that we all—each one of us—could “see
ourselves as others see us!” but, unfortunately, we never
can.</p>

<p>To return, however, to the subject-matter in hand.</p>

<p>Should it happen that you are chiefly resident in the
country, or that you enjoy the luxury of complete immunity
from city life for even a portion of the year, defer
riding until that time of times comes round, and then <em>teach
yourself</em>, by simply following a trustworthy code of instructions
laid down by some reliable authority.</p>

<p>This may sound as though I had, after all, but little real
faith in riding-masters. It is certainly not so meant. I
would not for a passing moment cast the smallest slur upon
a painstaking and often much-maligned body of men, many
of whom are capable of bringing a pupil forward in an
almost marvellous manner, by the excellence of their
method, and that ready observance of so-called “trifles,”
in other words, a quick eye, and rapid detection of anything
that is amiss, which are the riding-master’s most
valuable attributes. Nevertheless, despite the good opinion
in which I hold many instructors of the art, I am a very
strong believer in the efficacy of self-help, and just as a
novice at skating will, in spite of many sore falls and painful
<a id="Page_28" href="#Page_28" class="pagenum" title="28"> </a>
bruises, acquire skill if left to himself, long in advance
of his brother-learner who is trusting to somebody to bring
him along (being pretty certain to come down with a run
whenever that “somebody” considers it expedient to let
go), so, in like manner, I shall be ready to back my pupil,
although I may never have seen her, to hold her position
across country, in the park, by lane, street, or roadway,
against the city demoiselle, who in a fashionable school has
been taught to ride upon a carpet of tan, and who would
be as much at sea in a crowded thoroughfare, or endeavouring
to cross an intricate hunting-country, as an inexperienced
vocalist would be if called upon to interpret the
difficulties of Wagner or Bach.</p>

<p>Let me here especially impress upon you that, if you
value your prospects as a future good rider, you should not
suffer anything to induce you to accept the services as
instructor of John the coachman, or James the groom. It
is lamentable to see the manner in which parents and
guardians of the present day give up the teaching of their
charges to this class of persons, not one of whom has any
more idea of how a lady ought to manage a horse, than of
instructing her in the etiquette of the dinner-table, or the
intricacies of the valse. On the evils of the system, I need
not now enlarge; they ought to be apparent to even the
most obtuse; suffice it to say, that fathers and mothers
who permit their daughters to be taught by studgrooms
ought not to wonder when these personages impart
another and different style of knowledge to the pupils
whom they have been unwisely privileged to instruct.</p>
<a id="Page_29" href="#Page_29" class="pagenum" title="29"> </a>

<p>To provide yourself with a suitable horse will be the
first thing necessary. It is a cruel injustice to a pupil
for a master to expect her to learn upon any chance
animal that may happen to come in her way. Never
attempt such a thing. Respect your rights, and exercise
your privilege by selecting an appropriate mount. If it is
not within your power to do so at the time, put off your
practice until it is. I cannot sufficiently urge upon you
the importance of this advice. It is the very direst mistake
for a beginner to attempt to learn upon an indifferent
animal. Bear in mind that first impressions are never
forgotten, that you will take all your future ideas of riding
from the sensations which you derive from your elementary
practice of the art, and, believe me, if you make your
opening venture upon the back of a happy-go-lucky beast,
one who is sometimes well-conducted, but oftener not, or
who shies, or goes upon his shoulders, or indulges in
cross-legged movements, or throws up his head, or bores
(which is a still more objectionable habit), or if you are
called upon to gain your first experience upon a rough
trotter, or a loose galloper, who, to use a stable term, goes
“slummucking” all over the place, you will care but little
for riding during the remainder of your life. The discomforts
which such things entail will dwell unpleasantly
in your memory, and in fact create an ineffaceable
impression; so much so, that even if, later on, you happen
to be suitably mounted, a long time will have to elapse
before those early impressions can be eradicated, or
induced to fade even partially away, and a still longer one
<a id="Page_30" href="#Page_30" class="pagenum" title="30"> </a>
will go by before you can acquire that <em>confidence</em> which is
one of the first and chiefest necessities of a good and easy
rider.</p>

<p>While on this subject, I may say that a timid horsewoman
will never be a successful one. She may just
as well give up the pursuit at once, for her rides will
always be a punishment to her. With some, timidity is a
natural weakness which cannot be got over, but with the
majority it is the result of early impressions—an uncomfortable,
unfading recollection of having learnt upon
an unsuitable mount.</p>

<p>To illustrate what I say: most children are fond of
driving, because they have never associated the pastime
with other than pleasurable sensations. Neither risk nor
discomfort is, as a rule, connected with the simple carriage
exercise to which so many young persons are from babyhood
accustomed; but, give a child his first experience of
it by driving him in an open phaeton, behind a shying,
kicking, or backing horse—one that winds up a long list
of vagaries by spilling the vehicle and its occupants into
an unpleasant dyke, and if that child does not carry his
primary impressions through many a long course of after
drives, I am a less sapient observer of human nature than I
am generally accredited with being.</p>

<p>A lady’s horse, to be suitable, should be perfect in
temper and training. Beauty may be dispensed with,
decided acquisition though it undoubtedly is, but disposition
and education may not. They are absolute necessities
which cannot be done without, although a really <em>skilled</em>
<a id="Page_31" href="#Page_31" class="pagenum" title="31"> </a>
horsewoman may, without undue risk, ride any animal
that is fit for a man to ride, provided he be not fidgetty in
mounting, or a decidedly hard-mouthed puller: two points
with which I shall have to deal by-and-by.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<span class="chapter-title">SELECTING A MOUNT.</span></h2>


<p>The purchase of a saddle horse requires a grave amount of
consideration, especially as ignorant persons are apt to
think that “anything will do for a beginner.” Every
second person to whom you make known your requirement
will be ready to put you in the way of securing “the nicest
little horse in the world.” Gentlemen friends from every
quarter will have something cut and dried for you to invest
in; amateur dealers will persecute you; professionals will
harry your life out; John, the coachman, will make himself
odious by recommending some highly undesirable animal
and stolidly determining to see no virtue in any other.
You won’t know at first what his object can possibly be,
but by-and-by you will find out that he and the owner of
the property have come to an agreement concerning a
certain little “tip” to be made over to John, in the event of
his inducing you to become the possessor of the decided
acquisition in horseflesh on which his own affections are
set; and then, when you decline to be victimised, John will
assume a stony appearance, and obstinately refuse to be
interested in any other purchase.</p>

<p>You should be slow to select a horse, with a view to
<a id="Page_33" href="#Page_33" class="pagenum" title="33"> </a>
buying him, unless you can command the aid of a
competent and disinterested judge. Do not take the <i>onus</i>
upon yourself, for I grieve to say there is not any species
of trade in which there is so much dishonesty and such a
terrible amount of deception. If, however, you should
happen to be thrown altogether upon your own resources,
act thus (or get some one to do it for you): Go to the
most respectable of the trade; it is your best safeguard.
In former times, men like Scott and Anderson were so far
above suspicion that the veriest tyro was safe in their
hands. There are others of the present day of whom the
same may be said. Find out one of them, tell him to
what price you can go, and see <em>the best</em> that he can give
you for it. If he happens to have what pleases you in
price and appearance, get the animal examined by a
reliable veterinary surgeon, and ask for a trial. Buy
nothing without it. If refused, rest assured that something
is amiss. Dealers and grooms, even the honestest of
them, have ways of their own for pulling horses together,
and making them step up and show themselves: ay, and
for covering their defects, too, of which ladies, as a rule,
know nothing at all. Therefore, when you fix upon an
animal, get him <em>ridden</em> by a friend on whose judgment you
can rely,—not in a hurried manner, in the dealer’s yard,
but for an hour or so upon the road—and also for a turn
upon grass. A correct opinion can then, but not otherwise,
be formed concerning his paces, and the amount of training
and discipline to which he has been subjected.</p>

<p>A lady’s horse should, as I have said, possess perfect
<a id="Page_34" href="#Page_34" class="pagenum" title="34"> </a>
manners. If he romps with his head, pulls heavily against
the hand, leans weightily upon the bit, crosses his legs,
goes clumsily upon his shoulders, or, in short, renders his
rider in any way uncomfortable or unsafe, he is as unsuitable
for you as though he were addicted to some actual
vice. To be brief, he is not fitted for his office.</p>

<p>If, on the contrary, he can be ridden upon grass with a
common snaffle and a single rein—not pulling, and going
well up to his bridle—the making of his mouth has at least
been properly attended to; he is fit to be a lady’s horse.
I do not consider that any animal is so who requires a
curb; but the subject of bitting is of too great importance
to be merely touched upon here. I shall give some
practical advice about it in a future chapter.</p>

<p>In the event of your purchasing a horse from a friend,
adopt precisely the same rules as though buying him from
a dealer, unless the animal be one with whom you are
perfectly well acquainted. In such a case his price will be
the only question; but if there is nothing amiss with him,
and your friend is a person of honesty and good sense, he
will freely grant you both a trial and an opinion, and will
be rather pleased than otherwise that you should demand
them, as the responsibility of the sale will then be lifted
from his shoulders.</p>

<p>In selecting a horse, discard anything that is too large.
A lady who is not a welter-weight does not require a
weight-carrier, nor does she look well upon one either.
See that he has good fore-legs, and has not any tendency
to being what is termed “over at the knees,” for if he has
<a id="Page_35" href="#Page_35" class="pagenum" title="35"> </a>
an inclination that way he will be very likely to come
down, and a sure-footed horse is positively essential to the
comfort and safety of a lady rider. Bent knees denote a
weakness of the muscles and tendons of the back of the leg,
and are therefore to be reckoned as fatal to a roadster,
although, strange to say, they are not thought nearly so
objectionable in a racer, his price being in some instances
not very materially lessened by them. This is owing to
the fact that in the gallop they do not tell against an
animal, while in the trot they do, very materially.
“Diamond,” who was, some years ago, the winner of many
important races, was so marred in appearance by this
defect, that when standing still he always looked ready
to topple over upon his knees; yet sportsmen know what
a brilliant cross-country performer he was, and what a price
Joe Anderson—dear old man! still living, and hearty, though
deaf as any post—gave for him after his win at La Marche.</p>

<p>I have not the objection that most persons have to a
hollow-backed horse, especially when designed to carry
a lady’s saddle. It is infinitely preferable to anything
approaching a roach-back, and animals distinguished by
it are, strange to say, generally possessed of a variety of
excellent points—extreme good temper and docility being
among the most prominent. An unduly marked sinking
of the spine is certainly not to be desired, but an animal
who has what grooms term “a touch of a dip,” need not on
any account be rejected for it.</p>

<p>A wise purchaser will always make a careful examination
of the angles of the lips. A decided hardness about
<a id="Page_36" href="#Page_36" class="pagenum" title="36"> </a>
them, although an unfavourable symptom, need not
condemn the animal; it may have been occasioned by
abuse of the bit, or by the use of an improper one. A
cicatrix on the mouth is a defect, as showing that the true
skin has been removed from its place, and if a decided
induration, or anything like a lump can be felt in the
vicinity of it, evidence is afforded that the animal is a
puller. He ought not to be purchased for a lady’s use.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus-037-1.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>A NATURAL AND AN UPRIGHT PASTERN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A good foot is an indispensable adjunct. I am not in
favour of over long, or excessively sloping pasterns,
although they are preferable to those that are either too
much shortened, or unduly <em>upright</em>. Where the latter defect
exists, it indicates, in my opinion, a thickening and rigidity
of the flexor muscles, and produces an unsafe method of
planting the feet, particularly in walking. A light, supple
pliant pastern is a great beauty. I have often watched a
thoroughbred racer trotting over turf. The fetlock actually
<em>tips the ground</em>, or seems to do so, at every step, and if
elasticity and slenderness of this portion of a horse’s
anatomy were to be regarded as indications of weakness,
very few finely-bred animals would ever pass the post at all.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus-037-2.jpg" width="550" height="226" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>HOOFS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Strong <em>high</em> hoofs, with broad, firm, well-shaped heels,
are most desirable; though I know that in saying this I
am challenging a large array of contrary opinions. I have
heard many persons found their liking for low hoofs on the
ground that an excess of horny substance checks expansion,
and pinches the internal substance. This is, with all
due respect, a fallacy. The hoof <em>cannot</em> press upon or
injure the internal portion of the foot, any more than a
<a id="Page_37" href="#Page_37" class="pagenum" title="37"> </a>
well-developed skull can bruise or hamper the healthy
brain which it has been created to protect. I cannot
believe in the excellence of short, straight hoofs, with
narrow heels, nor can I forego my opinion, although once
or twice I have had to fight for it, that the best bred and
safest horses have their feet standing close together, with
the toes pointing <em>forwards</em>, in preference to a tendency to
point either outwardly or in. The leg should be straight
and firm, the knee-joint flat and broad, the shin hard, the
forearm lengthy, and the limbs large and well-developed
<a id="Page_38" href="#Page_38" class="pagenum" title="38"> </a>
where they emerge from, or rather join, the trunk. The
thorax should be wide; a narrow one is invariably accompanied
by low withers (a great defect), and by upright
shoulders, which is another. As it is, moreover, sacred to
the purposes of respiration and circulation, its proper
dimensions should be regarded as an all-important point.</p>

<p>A nice horse, in colour, for a lady to ride is a dark chestnut
or bay. Browns and blacks are generally serviceable
also, but greys and roans are objectionable, owing to the
hairs coming off upon the habit. About fifteen-two is a
good height for a horse which is to carry a rider of average
proportions. He should have well-set <em>sloping</em> shoulders—oblique
pasterns—clean, shapely legs—firm feet—and long,
easy, <em>swinging</em> action, which is vastly better and more
comfortable than that chin-knocking motion which lovers
of what is showy run after and affect. The lady’s horse
should carry his head handsomely, being neither a star-gazer
nor a borer, and his back should be somewhat longer
than might be thought altogether desirable in a horse
intended for a man to ride, in order to give ample room for
the side-saddle. He should have a moderately high forehand,
be firm and flexible in all his movements, and be at
least 20 lb. above the weight he is meant to carry; by
which I mean that if you are, say, 8½ st., or from that to 9 st.,
and that your saddle and appurtenances (including your
riding gear) weigh 2 st. extra, or a trifle over, you should
select for your use an animal well up to 13 st. or thereabouts.
To overweight a horse is both cruel and unwise,
especially when a lady is the aggressor—which sounds
strange, as female equestrians generally ride with tolerably
<a id="Page_39" href="#Page_39" class="pagenum" title="39"> </a>
light hands, and rarely stop out for any great length of
time together, except on particular occasions. Nevertheless,
their position on horseback, sitting far back
and in a side attitude, entails a good deal of additional
fatigue upon an animal; nor has the lady’s horse the advantage
(a great one) which
pertains to that of a man—namely,
being eased now and
again by the rider standing
in the stirrups when galloping,
or jumping off for a
moment or two when opportunity
offers.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus-039.jpg" width="265" height="500" alt="A rider of more matronly build" />
</div>

<p>I have always thought it a
pity that ladies do not select
their saddle horses with a
view to their being somewhat
in keeping with their own
style of appearance. It would
be an immense advantage
if they did. A slender, willowy
figure will always look
best on a light-limbed animal—one
of spirit and breeding,
full of quality, and as nearly as possible thoroughbred—whereas
a rider of more matronly build should select an
animal of medium height, with broad, strong back, powerful
quarters, big, healthy hocks, and stoutly-built forelegs.
She will look infinitely better on him, and be more safely
carried, than if mounted upon a slender weed.</p>
<a id="Page_40" href="#Page_40" class="pagenum" title="40"> </a>

<p>So much for appearance. Now a brief word about other
matters.</p>

<p>Do not buy a horse that is not a good walker, however
perfect he may seem to be in other respects. I have
always attached great importance to an animal’s walking
powers. It is a pace more generally adopted than any
other when out for a pleasure ride, and if you really want
to enjoy this last-named recreation, have nothing to do with
an indifferent walker, though he be offered you for a song.</p>

<p>About four and a half miles an hour is a good walking
pace—excellent, indeed, when <em>leaving</em> stable. The horse
that accomplishes it will generally walk at the rate of
five miles an hour when coming home. A good walker
will neither stumble, drop, shuffle, nor break. Everybody
knows what the first and third mentioned of these defects
signify. “Dropping” is a most uncomfortable fault: a
sort of inclination to <em>duck downwards</em> in front, or indeed
more generally with the hinder part of the body. Few
young horses that are not overweighted are apt to do it,
and when they do, it is a sign of weakness of the muscles;
they are unsafe to ride. “Breaking” is an inclination to
get into a canter, or trot, and is one of the symptoms of
defective training. I like to see a horse walk steadily
down hill, with head well up, and feet firmly planted. It
is an excellent test.</p>

<p>“Brushing” is a dangerous drawback, and so is “cutting.”
The first means striking one ankle against the other: the
second is hitting the shoe against the other leg—a practice
which involves considerable wounding and bleeding. Fast
trotters frequently do it—therefore, if selecting one, look
<a id="Page_41" href="#Page_41" class="pagenum" title="41"> </a>
out for its signs. A horse that cuts or brushes with the
<em>fore</em>-legs is thoroughly unfit for saddle use: he may come
down like a shot at any moment.</p>

<p>The training of a lady’s horse should render him steady
in every respect: perfectly quiet to mount, light mouthed,
and ready to obey the smallest touch of the rein, without
showing skittishness. An animal that bounces about
when his mouth is felt, or whilst waiting to be mounted,
is anything but a treasure to possess. He should not
be a puller, though ridden in any description of bridle—nor
should his action when trotting be rough or <em>jerky</em>.
If this latter be not looked to, his rider will constantly
suffer from undue fatigue.</p>

<p>That a lady’s horse should be sound and healthy is
nothing short of a necessity—nor ought he to have any
glaring defects, or blemishes, visible about his person—although
a single one, if it be trifling—the result, say, of a
former wound, blister, or scar—need not cause him to be
rejected; in fact, it often happens that some excellent
animals can be had quite cheap at the end of a hard
hunting season, because they have got a little bit knocked
about, although in many cases it does not tell against them
in the smallest degree.</p>

<p>Very many persons—Irish at all events—will remember
the beautiful “Adonis” who created so marked a sensation
in the parade of prize-takers before the Lord-Lieutenant at
one of the last of the Dublin Horse Shows, that was held in
the grounds of the Royal Dublin Society in Kildare Street.
He had a conspicuous blemish on the right side of his
chest, the result of a car-shaft that had been driven through
<a id="Page_42" href="#Page_42" class="pagenum" title="42"> </a>
his body only five months previous to the show; yet his
patching up had been almost perfect, and he commanded
an excellent price, though nothing at all to be compared
with the sums I had been offered for him before the
accident occurred. This carries out what I have said respecting
the chances of being sometimes able to secure a
good animal, even a prize-winner, at a comparatively low
figure, owing to some outward blemish, which, although
slightly disfiguring, is not in any way prejudicial to the
health, action, or general appearance of the intended purchase—or
to his real value, when considered from a “useful
purpose” point of view.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

<span class="chapter-title">THE LADY’S DRESS ON HORSEBACK.</span></h2>


<p>I think I shall make this a chapter upon Dress. Not that
the subject ought, perhaps, rightfully to come in just here,
without first introducing some more details about the horse—but
I know it to be a popular one with ladies, and it will
make a pleasing variety from drier matter, which can be
made to hold over very well until by-and-by.</p>

<p>In the days of Gottfried and the fair Maid of Ghent,
ladies rode upon long-tailed palfreys, attired in embroidered
robes of velvet or brocade. A century later we find them
wearing cloth manufactured into riding gear, but fashioned
so extraordinarily as to set us marvelling how on earth
they ever bore the weight, or kept their skirt-tails even
moderately clean. So far down as the first half of the
present century trailing habits were worn, and about that
period we find many allusions to the absurd custom, which
would seem to convey something like admiration of it.
For example, Charlotte Bronté, describing the return of a
riding-party in ‘Jane Eyre,’ says, “Her purple riding-habit
almost swept the ground;” a very questionable grace, in
my opinion, and a highly dangerous one.</p>

<p>Even in the present day our risible faculties are sometimes
<a id="Page_44" href="#Page_44" class="pagenum" title="44"> </a>
excited by the sight of some countrified equestrian,
clad in the old-fashioned attire of our mothers’ or grandmothers’
epoch—skirt six feet long, and quite four yards in
width; bodice with long basque, neck completely open,
displaying a huge expanse of shirt, finished off below the
chin with a red bow, or a blue one, or a green, as the case
may be; sleeves of enormous dimensions, both wide and
long, and braiding enough to set up a regiment of Hussars.
There was a girl in the park last season who wore a habit
such as I have described, with the addition of soiled white
kid gloves, and an extraordinarily tall hat, with a very
narrow straight leaf, and evidently much too large to fit
her head, for it went bobbing over her eyes at every step
of her ungainly steed. Thousands of laughing glances
were directed towards her, but she never minded, and only
seemed pleased; possibly she thought they were signs of
admiration—and her pleasant, healthy face was aglow with
delighted satisfaction.</p>

<p>What a pity, I thought, that she had not the benefit of
that inestimable looking-glass, a friend’s eye. Somebody
ought to have told her what an exhibition she was, yet
evidently nobody did; so ready are we to ridicule others,
without offering help.</p>

<p>A learner’s first costume may be as primitive as her
knowledge of the art—yet certain particulars concerning
it ought not to be overlooked, and while considering them
I shall adopt my former unceremonious mode of address,
and speak as friend to friend.</p>

<p>To begin, then, with your head. Leave your hair
<a id="Page_45" href="#Page_45" class="pagenum" title="45"> </a>
floating, perfectly loose—untrammelled by so much as a
ribbon. The object of this is that you may not have any
temptation to remove your hands from the position in
which the master has placed them, or anything to divert
your mind from the subject with which it is engaged.<!--TN: added period-->
Were you to take your riding lessons with hair plaited
neatly up in a coil, you would probably become conscious,
after a round or two of jolting, that a tail was sticking
uncomfortably out at one side, while a cold hair-pin would
perhaps make you shudder by sliding down your back.
Then, if your hand was not immediately lifted to rectify it,
the tail would rapidly increase in length and volume, and a
perfect <em>rain</em> of hair-pins would begin to descend upon your
shoulders. This is precisely what a riding-master dreads
and detests—for fingers and attention are alike employed
to rectify the damage, which cannot be done in a hurry,
but takes a long time,—and so discomfort reigns paramount
until the lesson is over.</p>

<p><em>Always</em>, while a learner, ride with your hair unbound, and
wear a soft hat or cap upon your head, fastened securely
with an elastic beneath the chin. This latter does not look
pretty, but that need not matter very much; there will not
be many to see it, and even were it otherwise, the sensible
among them would applaud your foresight, and commend
you for providing against the discomforts attendant on a
hat that would go rolling off with every motion of the
horse you were riding.</p>

<p>Your jacket should be more than easy-fitting: it should
be loose—allowing the figure full play, and giving special
<a id="Page_46" href="#Page_46" class="pagenum" title="46"> </a>
liberty to the arms, which should never be hampered in
any way.</p>

<p>The shape of it need not trouble you; beauty and
fashion can be dispensed with till by-and-by. Your skirt
should be wide and short; the make of it will not matter;—as
in the case of the jacket, let “cut” give place to comfort.
Do not wear a hard stiff collar, or anything that would
irritate or distract your mind. Never wear petticoats on
horseback, even from the first. To do so is a grave mistake.
I advocate the purchase of proper riding trousers, to
be worn from the very beginning, and they, of course, obviate
the necessity for any such garment. I have heard persons
speak in favour of flannel combinations, made to fit quite
loose, and must confess that, having never tried them, I am
not in a position to condemn, but my prejudices are
certainly not in favour of them. If not fitted with elastic
below the knees, they would most assuredly ruck up and
make their wearer miserable; and if so supplied, the legs
of them would turn round and round until the backs were
almost twisted to the front, a state of things terribly
uncomfortable, and one that could not be remedied without
getting off. If, however, there is a decided predilection in
favour of these extremely undesirable garments, the
twisting process may in great measure be obviated by
attaching a piece of good firm elastic, long enough to pass
under the sole of the foot, to each side of the leg of the
combinations. This answers the purpose of a man’s
trouser strap, but must, if adopted by a lady, be worn under
the boot. It is, I must say, surprising to me that the
<a id="Page_47" href="#Page_47" class="pagenum" title="47"> </a>
combination, or knickerbocker garment, should ever have
received the notice of juvenile riders, inasmuch as it leaves
the leg, from the knee down, entirely uncovered, save by
the stocking, except when long boots are worn; and we all
know that the limbs of a learner are far more tender and
liable to abrasion than are those which have become
saddle-hardened and inured to rubs.</p>

<p>Boots should be well-fitting, broad-soled, and made
without buttons, bows, or anything that could possibly
catch in the stirrup, or require disentanglement when
about to dismount. High heels should <em>never</em> be worn.</p>

<p>Gloves are of little consequence, provided that they are
soft and large. Of the two I like to see beginners ride
without them, except when the weather is cold. A good
strong woollen or cloth pair will then be found preferable
to any kind of leather.</p>

<p>A whip you will not require, therefore I need not speak
of it; neither will you have any need of a spur.</p>

<hr class="break" />

<p>Having thus disposed of your requirements as a learner,
we come to consider your more advanced costume, and I
shall find need to speak of every requisite for park, road,
and country riding—reserving the hunting outfit for the last.</p>

<p>If you are a moderate rider, three hats will be sufficient
for you; a silk one, which I prefer low-crowned; a jerry,
or melon-shaped; and a soft felt. These should be all of
the finest quality; in fact, I may here take occasion to
warn you against cheap or indifferent articles of riding
apparel; they are, in all instances, by far the dearest in the
<a id="Page_48" href="#Page_48" class="pagenum" title="48"> </a>
end. For my own part I really look with horror upon
low-priced articles of clothing—not from any snobbishness,
far from it, but because I have always found them wear
so badly, look so unsightly after short service, and adapt
themselves so indifferently to the wearer, that a perfect
abhorrence of all so-called “bargains” has been the not
unnatural result.</p>

<p>You should have at least two riding-habits—one of
heavy, the other of light material. Wolmershausen and
Co., of Curzon-street, Mayfair, are constantly showing
a variety of beautiful stuffs, suitable for all places, in
town and country, and for all weathers likewise. They
are the introducers of the famous “Curzon Red,” in reality
a dark claret-colour of most charming hue, fine texture,
and durable quality, being perfectly impervious to the
effects of rain or sun.</p>

<p>I am frequently asked for advice respecting the
newest fashion in the cut of riding habits—the form or
shape of the bodice, and so forth. The very best I can
give is to go to a good maker, and leave the matter
entirely in his hands, not hindering him by the setting
forth of any ideas of your own. If he be a master tailor
he will know his business, and will not relish interference.
Should you, however, be called upon to give directions to
a provincial or country workman of doubtful capacity, send
for a good pattern of a skirt, and then get your tailor to
cut it out in coarse, rough calico, and to tack it lightly
together. Finally, let him adjust it to your shape <em>when on
horseback</em>, making quite certain that the fit of it shall be
<a id="Page_49" href="#Page_49" class="pagenum" title="49"> </a>
perfect before attempting to cut it out in cloth. By this
simple process you and he will be spared much disappointment,
and you will be saved unnecessary expense. A well-cut
habit-skirt should fit without wrinkle or fold; it should
be barely long enough to cover the left foot; there should
not be a particle of superfluous cloth about it; the end of
the hem should form a line as nearly as possible horizontal;
and the circumference <em>inside</em> the hem should certainly not
exceed two and a-half yards, even for the most matronly
rider.</p>

<p>I adhere to the belief that no habit-skirt can be properly
adjusted unless the maker of it can have the advantage of
adapting it to the figure of the intended wearer while she
sits on horseback. All fashionable tailors have model or
block horses, on which they mount their customers, and by
no other plan can a perfect fit be secured. It must be
borne in mind that the better shaped a habit-skirt is for
riding the more unsightly it looks when seen on a standing
figure, or when held in the hand; in fact, it is then a
seemingly hideous and “all wrong” thing, full of irregularities,
and apparently without form and void—whereas,
when viewed in the saddle, it adapts itself to the figure of
the wearer, and falls into perfectly correct and shapely lines.</p>

<p>All modern habit-bodices are made entirely without perceptible
basque, having merely the coat-tail at the back.
Some are made to open at the throat, and these look smart
with a white or pale buff scarf tie. Others, again, are slightly
opened at the waist, or very much so at the breast, displaying
fancy waistcoats of various kinds and patterns,
<a id="Page_50" href="#Page_50" class="pagenum" title="50"> </a>
some of them quite startling in colour and design. The
fashion is, in my opinion, not one to follow. The nicest
shaped bodice for a lady is one made closely buttoned up,
almost to the throat, showing merely a small linen collar
above the braid or neck-band, with the addition of a neat
tie of no conspicuous colour. The bodice itself should be
entirely free from ornament of any sort whatever.</p>

<p>I think it a good plan, although some tailors reject it,
to have two large strong hooks attached to the back of the
bodice, with eyes of corresponding size affixed in proper
position to the band of the skirt. When these are fastened
there can be no danger of getting “out of gear.”</p>

<p>Bodices which open much at the throat are very apt to
give colds and coughs to the wearers of them. There is
an old saying that pride feels no pain, and certainly ladies
who fancy their own appearance in this particular style
of garment are unfortunately only too apt to forget, or overlook,
its tendency to admit the chill blasts and treacherous
breezes which frequently make havoc with the most
delicate portion of the frame. Nobody could condemn
the practice of muffling up the throat more heartily than
I do myself, but to leave the chest exposed to harsh wintry
winds—as I frequently see done—with only a trifle of silk or
muslin to serve as a protector, seems to me to be positively
suicidal. I therefore recommend that when open bodices
are worn in chilly weather, a fold of chamois, or warm soft
flannel, should be placed across the chest.</p>

<p>A habit-bodice should fit closely, without crease or
wrinkle, but ought not to be by any means tight; if it be so,
<a id="Page_51" href="#Page_51" class="pagenum" title="51"> </a>
all comfort in riding will be destroyed. I am confidently
of opinion that half the ladies who canter their horses
in the park and never attempt to trot them, only adopt
the fashion because they themselves are too tightly laced
to effect the rise in the saddle. This system of compression
is a great mistake. If ladies could only be induced to
believe it, it certainly adds nothing to their charms, for
Nature will not allow herself to be put out of sight, and
the figure that is crushed in at the centre by unduly
tightened corsets must bulge out above or below them—sometimes
both—in a manner that is by no means pleasant
to contemplate. Putting aside, therefore, all questions
connected with hygienic principles, the fashion of squeezing
the waist is not one to be recommended.</p>

<p>I believe that a great many ladies who are not by any
means naturally stout or clumsy, are made to appear so by
wearing cheap and ill-fitting corsets; while, on the other
hand, figures that are inclined to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">embonpoint</i> can, with the
assistance of a judicious and capable stay-maker, be
invested with an appearance of grace and slimness that is
not by nature their own. To expect a habit-cutter to fit
a bodice over a seven-and-sixpenny corset, with two long
bones, bald and unsoftened, sticking up at the top of the
back, hip-pieces too wide, and front steels long and
obtrusive, is as great a piece of injustice as to expect an
artist to paint a picture with broken brushes, or a cook to
furnish a banquet without the proper materials.</p>

<p>I cannot refrain from dwelling a little upon this subject,
because it seems to me that ladies are very often—without
<a id="Page_52" href="#Page_52" class="pagenum" title="52"> </a>
meaning it, perhaps—a trifle unjust, not to say tyrannical,
blaming their tailors, and even speaking against them in
influential quarters, for faults in fitting, which are in reality
entirely attributable to their own obstinacy (combined,
perhaps, with a little bit of parsimony), in neglecting the
advice given them: namely, to purchase well-made corsets
from an artist in that particular branch of industry. To
lay a good foundation is at all times, howsoever applied, an
excellent rule, and the corset is the foundation on which the
habit-bodice must, as it were, be <em>built</em>. Your figure may be
ever so charming in all its outlines and details, but if that
which helps to mould it is in reality only calculated to
disfigure, the effect cannot be otherwise than unsatisfactory
and bad.</p>

<p>Habit-sleeves ought not to be too long. To end within
two inches of the hand is the correct thing, the space to be
filled up by a spotless linen cuff. Ample room should be
given at the elbows, and at the setting-in of the sleeves,—otherwise
there will be discomfort, and a continual tendency
to run up.</p>

<p>The system of shotting habits at the hem has happily
entirely gone out. According to the present rule of skirt
cutting, it certainly is not required, but for fair equestrians
who are unduly nervous about exposing even the smallest
portion of understanding, a good plan is to have a band
of broad elastic affixed to the inside of the skirt, in such
a position as to enable the toe of the right foot to be
thrust through it, while a similar band does duty for the
left. These appliances cannot be properly arranged by
<a id="Page_53" href="#Page_53" class="pagenum" title="53"> </a>
even the most skilful tailor, unless the wearer of the
habit is ready to seat herself on horseback, or on a block
horse, for his benefit and assistance. The necessity for
this is obvious, as the precise position of the bands, or loops,
must be regulated by the rider’s length of limb, otherwise
they may be altogether wrongly placed, and, when used,
have only the unsatisfactory effect of dragging the skirt
completely out of form. Some authorities have censured
me for advocating this plan at any cost, declaring it to be
highly dangerous in case of a fall. I should like to know
how it is so, seeing that it does not involve the possibility of
dragging, or place a lady in any sort of peril. The theory
is about as sensible as others of the kind, which ignorant
persons—or men who attempt to write for ladies—not unfrequently
lay down. For riders who are, nevertheless,
apprehensive of danger from this source, reassurance may
be found by using Nicoll’s patent safety-band for the right
foot opening with a spring—so that, in the event of a fall,
the rider is not kept in a cramped position upon the ground,
but can at once make an effort to regain her feet, without
trouble to herself or damage to her garments.</p>

<p>Ladies who ride much in the country, especially in
summer weather, will derive comfort from the possession
of a gingham habit, or one of very lightest dust-coloured
summer cloth. I have had one of the latter myself, and it
wore splendidly—bearing a couple of washings into the
bargain when disfigured by dust on which a shower of rain
had fallen. I would have it borne in mind, however, that
cheap though the material may be, it <em>must</em> be tailor-made,
otherwise it will not be fit to wear.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<span class="chapter-title">THE LADY’S DRESS ON HORSEBACK (<i>continued</i>).</span></h2>


<p>No amateur manufacture can possibly look well on
horseback. The effect is like that which is produced when
men play cricket or tennis in
home-made flannels, or go to
fancy balls, or private theatricals
in costumes manufactured
by their wives. Please do not
imagine that nobody ever does
such things. To think so
would be indeed a fallacy—but
the effect is not a bit more
ludicrous than that of amateur
tailoring, especially when a back
view of the latter is obtained.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus-054.jpg" width="284" height="500" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>AMATEUR MANUFACTURE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Riding trousers come next
for mention. Many ladies
prefer them to breeches, and
when worn, they should be
made of chamois, with cloth
to match the habit extending
from the foot to about midway between the knee and the
hip. Chamois, if of good quality, is soft, elastic, serviceable,
<a id="Page_55" href="#Page_55" class="pagenum" title="55"> </a>
and most pleasant for wear, and side buttons are preferable
to an opening in front. Small, firm, well-adjusted straps
should be affixed to the ends of the legs, to prevent the
possibility of rucking up—an indescribably uncomfortable
sensation. These straps may be made of leather, though
many prefer elastic. I do not think it matters much which
of the two is used for ordinary riding, but if the latter, it
should be quite an inch in breadth, and should have a slit
worked in it, button-hole fashion, at each end (leaving a
good piece of the stuff beyond the slit), and by this means
be made to fasten to two buttons, stitched very firmly, one
on either side of the hem of the leg—on the inside, of
course. By adopting this arrangement the straps can be
readily changed—a great advantage, for elastic soon gets
worn out; and if you are a wise and methodical manager
you will have a second pair of straps always ready at hand,
to provide for unexpected contingencies. No lady who
rides much can possibly do without at least two pairs of
riding-trousers: a pair for each habit being in fact the
correct thing. I think it will be a boon for ladies to
know that Messrs. Tautz have introduced an acceptable
novelty in ladies’ riding and hunting <em>breeches</em>, a really
beautiful and durable article made of deer-skin—soft as
velvet, and elastic as a glove. Perfection in fit is secured
through the medium of a lady “fitter,” who is specially
relegated to the department, and it is a point in favour of
these breeches that they can be worn quite as readily
and comfortably with leggings or gaiters as with the more
sporting “tops.”</p>
<a id="Page_56" href="#Page_56" class="pagenum" title="56"> </a>

<p>The reference to these latter re-introduces the subject of
boots: one on which I have already lightly touched.
Never wear them tight—adopt the very plainest fashion—and
let the soles be moderately thick. If you prefer Wellingtons—which
many do—have your trousers cut away at
the instep and buttoned close at the ankle, with a small
strap to pass under the foot when in its stocking; or have
the boots drawn over the trousers, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la militaire</i>, so that
you can get into both at the same time. Captain Horace
Hayes pointed out to me the utility of this plan, and I have
found it answer excellently for myself—but it is not every
lady who can be brought to see the wisdom of wearing
boots large enough to admit of it.</p>

<p>If a spur be required, select a Sewarrow; but I am
against the indiscriminate use of such an appliance, and
always maintain that if a lady is riding a properly broken
horse she can have no possible need of a spur for ordinary
road or park riding. When hunting, it is, in my opinion,
an absolutely necessary adjunct, as also when training young
or vicious horses—but such employment is altogether distinct
from quiet, everyday exercise, and requires, in fact,
an entirely different equipment, of which the spur forms
only a part.</p>

<p>Stockings for riding should always, even in summer, be
of a heavier and warmer description than those worn when
walking, or in the house. I would have you remember,
also, that to garter them will have a tendency to make your
feet cold—a thing by no means pleasant or desirable,—therefore
use suspenders to keep them up.</p>
<a id="Page_57" href="#Page_57" class="pagenum" title="57"> </a>

<p>Corsets have already been discussed. Never, if at all
inclined to stoutness, use what is called a riding-belt, or
stay; in other words, an abbreviated and thoroughly
unsatisfying contrivance, neither high enough nor sufficiently
strong to serve as a support for the figure. It
is only excessively slight and naturally erect women who
can at all indulge in the wearing of such flimsy articles.</p>

<p>Web drawers of very light texture, such as are worn by
men, will be found agreeable for wear, and being so close-fitting
I have never found them move, or cause any
discomfort.</p>

<p>Chemises should be made barely long enough to meet
the saddle, or if worn a shade longer they should be
fashioned in the form of <em>trunks</em>, extending about midway
down the thighs. Nothing that can possibly ruck up
should ever be worn. I like to see chemises made in the
form of a man’s shirt, so far as neck, breast, and sleeves
are concerned—but collars and cuffs should be movable,
and all appliances complete for rendering an immediate
change of these articles a matter of no difficulty whatever.</p>

<p>Ladies who do not adopt the shirt-like form of chemise
frequently complain of the difficulty of keeping their cuffs
in right position. The best way to do this is to attach a
little loop of single-cord <em>round</em> elastic to the inside of the
habit-sleeve, and place a small firm button on the back of
the cuff, around which the elastic can be fastened with
perfectly satisfactory results.</p>

<p>Pins should never be employed for any purpose, except
about the head. This sounds strange, but I shall come
<a id="Page_58" href="#Page_58" class="pagenum" title="58"> </a>
to it by-and-by. Ribbons ought not to be used as ties,
especially gaudy ones—nor ought <em>anything</em> coloured
(including veils and flowers) ever be worn by a lady
rider who desires to lay claim to the possession of even
ordinary good taste. In this I am strongly opposed
to the opinions of “Vielle Moustache” and other well-known
authorities; but every man, and of course every
woman, has a full and just right to his and her own views
upon all such matters, and when we put them in print for
the benefit of others, it is with the object of directing and
advising by the reasonableness of them, rather than of
<em>coercing</em> by their weight or power.</p>

<p>Gloves should be of doeskin—or strong, fine quality
leather. They should be double-stitched in every part,
have at least two buttons, and be amply large, in order to
allow full play for the fingers and the muscles of the hand,
as likewise to admit of circulation going freely forward—for
extremities soon become chilled if cramped up in
coverings in which they cannot be easily and freely moved
about. I do not like white gloves, or yet black; a nice
dark shade of tan looks well—and some black stitching on
the backs is a decided improvement.</p>

<p>No ornaments ought to be worn when riding. A small
stud should fasten the collar: never a brooch; ear-rings
and bangles should be left at home; a watch-chain should
not be seen crossing the breast of a habit-bodice, nor
should a handkerchief ever be worn protruding from the
front of the bosom. This latter custom is simply an
abomination, which no rider of good taste would ever dream
<a id="Page_59" href="#Page_59" class="pagenum" title="59"> </a>
of adopting. Some, I know, regard it as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chic</i>: a principle
that makes them also keep their elbows out from their sides—but
with the vagaries of such persons I have happily
little to do, and certainly have very little sympathy.</p>

<p>Veils should be of black net, cut just deep enough to cover
the tip of the nose, without reaching below the nostrils, and
they ought to be sufficiently long to twist into the form of
a knot at the back of the hat, where they should be
secured with two short steel pins. Those which have round
shiny black heads are the best, being easily seized upon,
even by gloved fingers, when the hand is put back for the
purpose of removing them.</p>

<p>You will observe that I have said the veil should be
<em>twisted</em>, not actually knotted, at the back of the leaf of the
hat—for when it is the latter, there is always difficulty
in undoing it, and frequently the hat itself has to come
off before the veil can be successfully got rid of. Dust-veils,
of grey or black gauze, are extremely useful in the
country, but ought not to be worn in town—nor should
any description of <em>white</em> veil ever be seen on a lady’s
riding-hat, even though she be exercising in the wilds of
Connemara, or in a district as lonely as the deserts of the
East.</p>

<p>Whips are of many sorts and patterns. Select the
plainest among those of good description, and on no
account carry one that has a tassel appended. Never use
a hunting-crop except when going out with hounds, and
do not despise a neat little switch if riding in the heart
of the country.</p>
<a id="Page_60" href="#Page_60" class="pagenum" title="60"> </a>

<p>I think I have but one more point to notice before
concluding this portion of my subject. Be certain that
your hair is always most securely put up before setting
out to ride; unless, indeed, you are a juvenile, and wear it
loose. Make sure also that your hat is so well fastened
that it cannot, by any possibility, come off, either by the
influence of a high wind, or the sudden action of your
horse. A good deal must, of course, depend upon the
manner in which you arrange your coiffure. If your locks
are abundant—sufficient to make into a stout coil at the
back of your head—an elastic loop to pass under it will be
found an advantage. Should your hair, however, happen
to be light-coloured, this will look badly, and I therefore
recommend a plan which I have myself found very
effectual. Procure two steel pins such as I have recommended
for veil-fasteners—only much longer; pass them
through the leaf of the hat, about three inches apart; then
weave them securely in and out, in a transverse<!--TN: was 'tranverse'--> direction,
through the roll or plait of your hair, keeping the points of
them turned well outward. No danger can possibly accrue
from this system of pinning, if properly performed, even
though you may be unfortunate enough to fall upon your
head any number of times in the day.</p>

<p>For girls who wear their hair flowing free, I cannot
recommend any really perfectly safe method of securing a
hat, except by an elastic passed beneath the chin. It is
not a pretty way, certainly, but juveniles need not care
much about that.</p>

<p>You will find a warm winter jacket a great comfort in
<a id="Page_61" href="#Page_61" class="pagenum" title="61"> </a>
chilly weather. It ought to be tailor-made, and lined with
satin, to ensure its being easily slipped on and off over the
habit bodice. A little braiding will be a great set-off to
this, and a trimming of any good dark fur will also enhance
its appearance. I like astracan myself. The Empress of
Austria, when hunting in Cheshire in 1881, wore a lovely
over-jacket of dark blue cloth, trimmed with a deep
bordering of astracan, with collar and cuffs of the same
becoming fur. Large frog buttons, with double loops of
twisted braid, extended down the front. The corners
were rounded, and the shoulders ever so slightly raised at
the setting in. When she took it off one day at luncheon
time, I saw that it was lined with very glossy purple satin,
through which ran a tiny yellow stripe. Nothing could
have been prettier or more becoming.</p>

<p>A rain-proof cape, or jacket, will be likewise essential.
If you get the former, attach an elastic the circumference
of your waist to the inside of it at the extreme back—hem
the ends of this, and stitch a hook on one and an eye
on the other, to enable them to fasten in front. This will
prevent the wind from getting underneath the cape, and
you can ride quite comfortably, even in squally weather, by
bringing the ends of the elastic <em>over the fronts</em> of the cape
before securing them around your waist.</p>

<p>If you ride much in winter time, when wet days are of
frequent occurrence, you will find a couple of pairs of
celluloid cuffs, with collars to match, extremely useful.
They are universally known, and are now very cheap. All
india-rubber houses keep them, and they can be had, I
<a id="Page_62" href="#Page_62" class="pagenum" title="62"> </a>
believe, in every size. Being impervious to wet, they are
an improvement upon even the best starched linen (which
they strongly resemble in appearance), seeing that the
latter gets limp and wretched-looking after even a trifling
shower.</p>

<p>I think I have now entered into all particulars respecting
your ordinary riding gear. That for hunting will occupy a
chapter later on. Bear in mind that the more plainly you
are dressed, the quieter your appearance, and the less obtrusive
your style, the more ladylike you will appear, and
consequently the more to be commended and admired.
It is only horsebreakers and women of inferior social
standing who seek to attract attention by conspicuous
action and costume. A lady shows best that she is one by
neither doing nor wearing anything that is in the smallest
degree calculated to provoke remark.</p>

<p>I have really often thought that the reason why many
ladies look so much better in their riding-habits than in
ordinary walking attire, is that there is so much less opportunity,
when so dressed, for wearing what is unbecoming,
or for conforming to silly fashions which only serve
to distort and destroy all the beauties of the human
form divine. On horseback we are spared the unsightlinesses
of dress improvers, high heels, and high shoulders!
The natural outline of the figure is revealed to us, and
with it we can find but little fault. “God made man in
His own image,” said a country preacher to whom I
listened a short time since, “but woman makes an image
of herself!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<span class="chapter-title">BITTING.</span></h2>


<p>Having now provided yourself with a suitable mount for
road and park purposes, and likewise a supply of riding
apparel sufficient to answer all purposes until you come to
hunt, it will be necessary for you to turn your attention
to the interesting subjects of bitting, saddling, and general
turning out. These things ought of necessity to precede
the actual <em>riding</em>—for you certainly cannot mount your
steed until he has been saddled and bridled, and to know
how to accomplish this yourself is in the highest degree
important.</p>

<p>In the present day, when equestrianism is not only a
popular amusement but amounts almost to a craze, it is
astonishing to find the amount of ignorance that prevails
among riders upon subjects with which they ought to be at
least tolerably well acquainted, before laying claim to the
terms “horsemen” and “horsewomen.” In no department
that I can think of, or name, is this lamentable want of
knowledge so clearly displayed as in the important one of
bitting. That ladies are not, as a rule, very conversant
with the subject is scarcely to be wondered at, for most
lady-riders give no thought to anything on earth save the
<a id="Page_64" href="#Page_64" class="pagenum" title="64"> </a>
pleasure of the motion, and the fit of their habits and
gloves. They have undergone a certain description of
superficial training, which just enables them to know how
to sit, and how to hold the reins between their fingers, but
the real pleasure of being thoroughly <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en rapport</i> with their
mount—knowing what bit he will go best in, and feeling
conscious that he is not enduring torture from being
wrongly bridled or saddled—are things altogether denied
them. It is precisely the same principle on which ladies
execute showy pieces on the piano, without at the same
time having the smallest knowledge of the theory of music,
or any idea of why it is that pressure upon the pedals
is capable of altering the sound. It is a sorry fact, but
a certain one, that nine-tenths of the ladies who ride in the
Row—pulling equally, as they often do, upon both reins—would
stare at you in helpless amazement, or blush
“celestial rosy red,” if asked to describe the difference in
action between the curb bit and the snaffle. They do not
know. Nobody has ever told them, because it has never
occurred to them to ask. They are simply aware that
there are two leathers, attached by some unknown means
to the horse’s head, and that they are supposed to hold
these nicely between their fingers, and look as charming as
they can; but what the leathers are for, or why there
<em>are</em> two of them, or yet, why some other ladies of their
acquaintance ride with a single rein while they have been
given a double one, are things of which they have not the
very faintest notion. Lip-straps, cheek-pieces, throat-lashes,
ports, cannons, &amp;c., terms with which even moderately
<a id="Page_65" href="#Page_65" class="pagenum" title="65"> </a>
skilled horsewomen are familiar—have never been so much
as heard of, or even inquired about. The existence of
this species of ignorance among lady-riders is not hearsay.
I speak from practical knowledge, having proved it upon
many different occasions. “Pooh, nonsense; what do <em>I</em> care
about your old leathers!” laughed a merry-hearted Cork
girl to whom I was once striving to explain some necessary
matters; “I just hold on, and let the beast carry me—and
what more on earth do I want?” And away she went,
helter-skelter, after the hounds, as she spoke—holding on,
true enough, to both reins, with a good firm grip; and the
beast <em>did</em> carry her, to some purpose too, up to a big drain—and
finding his mouth unfairly dealt with in the taking-off,
landed her deftly into it, and ungallantly galloped away.</p>

<p>With men—those who ride, I mean—ignorance concerning
bitting ought never to exist, yet I have been fairly
astounded at finding out how very little many of them know
about the matter. An officer, who was considered a good
man to hounds, and who owned a couple of racers to boot,
looked actually quite puzzled when it was observed to him
one day that he was riding his hunter in a very severe
bit (a saw-mouth bridoon, attached to a snaffle), and said,
“By George, I don’t know. I suppose my confounded
servant put some queer thing or another on him, for the
beggar won’t go a yard!” He had actually mounted
his horse and set out for a day’s hunting without so much
as casting a <em>glance</em> at the animal’s head. Nor was his by
any means an isolated case.</p>

<p>Now a practical word or two about some of the bridles
<a id="Page_66" href="#Page_66" class="pagenum" title="66"> </a>
most generally in use—beginning with the common, smooth-jointed
snaffle, which has ever been my favourite bit. This,
when sufficiently wide and large, forms an absolutely
perfect bridle, and its action is extremely simple, restraining
the horse by pressure on the bars of the mouth when his
head is carried more or less perpendicularly, and on the
corners when the head is lifted or lowered. Owing to the
centre of the mouthpiece being jointed, there is very little
pressure on the tongue, which is one of the many points in
favour of this admirable bridle.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus-066.jpg" width="316" height="250" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>COMMON SNAFFLE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The common snaffle must not in any wise be confounded
with the ringed-snaffle which has a noseband attached to
the inner rings, kept in place by pieces of leather stitched
round them and brought under the ends of the cheeks.
It may be <em>made</em> to act severely by drawing one pair of
reins tight and sharp, thus causing all the pressure to concentrate
upon the horse’s nose—and is then called a Newmarket
snaffle.</p>
<a id="Page_67" href="#Page_67" class="pagenum" title="67"> </a>

<p>I append sketches of a common jointed snaffle, the
easiest and nicest bit that a thoroughly-trained horse can
possibly go in, and also a double-ringed one, such as I have
just described. The latter is frequently used by men when
breaking young horses in Irish hunting-fields, and is very
useful when servants have to be entrusted with the
handling of animals, for, severe though it may be made,
it cannot spoil a horse’s mouth so easily as can any
description of curb.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus-067.jpg" width="400" height="112" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>RINGED SNAFFLE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There is not among the whole range of bits any so mild
or suitable to a learner as the common snaffle. Captain
Horace Hayes, writing to me on the subject, says: “The
more imperfect the rider, the greater the necessity for using
a snaffle bridle; but this,” he adds, “goes without saying.
Persons are at times found to express such mad ideas about
horses and bitting that to reply to them is only to encourage
their folly.”</p>

<p>A big smooth bridoon (with or without horns), and a
solid Portmouth bit and curb, will be found a capital
hunting bridle. It has always been a favourite with me for
horses that do not want to get their tongues over the bit,
and where this objectionable habit does not exist, the
common-jointed snaffle or Pelham will be found very nice
<a id="Page_68" href="#Page_68" class="pagenum" title="68"> </a>
also. In using it, however, you must see that the headstall
is long enough for the pressure to lie on the bars of
the horse’s mouth. This should always be looked to by
the rider. If it has a tendency to crumple the lips at the
corners, it is wrong, and partakes of the nature of a gag.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus-068.jpg" width="274" height="300" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>JOINTED PELHAM.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Pelham bridle finds <em>many</em> advocates: Major Whyte
Melville liked it, for instance,—and for showing off paces
(if this alone be desired), I approve of the <i>Hanoverian</i>
Pelham, but not particularly for anything else. The Newmarket
snaffle is a capital bit for pullers, and the American
snaffle with india-rubber mouthpiece is a pleasant bridle,
largely used in the States for trotting purposes. The
Segundo, formerly a great favourite, is a very powerful
controller—while the Melton mouth-bit is deservedly a
<a id="Page_69" href="#Page_69" class="pagenum" title="69"> </a>
prime favourite with many riders. The Liverpool is greatly
used for harness, and seems to have quite superseded the
old Buxton, the bottom bar of which made it uncomfortably
liable to catch on the pole-end or shaft.</p>

<p>I dislike seeing a gag employed, and consider it altogether
unnecessary, except for a buck-jumper, or an animal
who determinately “bores” his head in a downward position;
nor am I at all in favour of the <em>twisted</em> snaffle,
which is a very severe bit, and does not answer any
purpose, so far as I have ever been able to make out, that
the chain-snaffle cannot be made to fulfil; for if severity be
required, it can be obtained by twisting the chain before
putting it into the horse’s mouth. I hate to see it, however,
and never would permit its use in my own stables, except in
the case of some animal that was known to be of an unusually
fractious, or, I might say, <em>evil</em> temper. Severity in bitting
<a id="Page_70" href="#Page_70" class="pagenum" title="70"> </a>
is, in my opinion, very rarely necessary; and taking into
account the cruelty of it, I dislike it excessively, and
always cry it down.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>I saw a man in Cheshire, when the Empress of Austria
was hunting there, riding in a terrible bridle. He had a
strong, wiry <em>rope-bit</em> attached to the horns of an ordinary
snaffle—and it must have been frightfully severe, for the
horse’s mouth was bleeding at both corners. I remarked
to the Kaiserin that it was no wonder she was anxious to
get away from that part of the country, if her sensitive eyes
were often thus shocked. She looked at the man—at the
horse—at the man again—and then said one word—“<span class="smcap">Brute!</span>”
It was certainly expressive, and concise,—and
she spoke it in right sound English too, which I thought a
very good thing.</p>
<a id="Page_71" href="#Page_71" class="pagenum" title="71"> </a>

<p>The ordinary term “bit and bridoon” means simply a
curb and a snaffle. The latter has been already explained.
The common curb is merely a mouthpiece attached to two
cheeks, and is curved in the centre, forming what is called
a “port,” while a chain is attached to the cheeks in such a
way that when the curb-reins are drawn tight, the chain
presses upon the <em>chin</em> of the horse, and so restrains him.</p>

<p>There is much variety in the shape of curbs, a Chifney
being the strongest, and therefore the most capable of
misuse in unpractised hands. A really good double bridle
for ordinary riding is a Dwyer curb (which has very short
cheeks), and a common smooth snaffle. The Cambridge
bit is also very generally esteemed.</p>

<p>For hunting purposes, I like the <em>snaffle</em> bridle to have
half horns only, as being less likely to be drawn in a
<a id="Page_72" href="#Page_72" class="pagenum" title="72"> </a>
scurry through the horse’s mouth, taking the curb along
with it. I have seen this happen once or twice, with very
unpleasant results.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus-072.jpg" width="400" height="193" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>HALF-HORNED HUNTING SNAFFLE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>To say that an animal is “hard-mouthed” is a very
general expression; but the notion that he is so constantly
arises from his being improperly bitted. Something or
another is thrust into his mouth that does not go near fitting
it, and as a consequence has no more effect in either checking
or guiding him than if it were tied to his tail. When
a horse is badly bitted, and controlled at the same time by
incompetent hands, the double evil is almost too great to
be endured; but when a proper bit is applied, there is far
less suffering and inconvenience on the part of the animal,
even though subjected to the hands of a very unlearned
master. Timid riders ought to know, and remember, that
as a horse is governed by his mouth—just as a ship is by
her rudder—it will be wise to devote especial attention to
that quarter, in order to avert the danger that may otherwise
ensue. A skilful and experienced hand at the bridle
will always prove the best means of success, and ensure
<a id="Page_73" href="#Page_73" class="pagenum" title="73"> </a>
the greatest amount of safety; but, where this does not
exist, the natural or acquired defect may in great measure
be counterbalanced by the application of a suitable bit.</p>

<p>Persons have positively laughed at me when I have
spoken of having a horse’s mouth measured—and yet there
are three interior measurements which ought to be carefully
made before fitting an animal with a bit: these are, the
width of the mouth, taking the measurement from the chin-groove—the
exact width of the channel in which the tongue
rests—and the height of the bars of the mouth, by which
I mean from the surface of them to the <em>undermost</em> point of
the chin-groove. If a bit with a port is to be used, the
horse’s tongue ought also to be measured.</p>

<p>It often happens that from improper bitting horses
acquire an ugly trick of working their tongues over the
mouthpiece. I had two that did it, but cured them by
riding them for awhile with a snaffle only, and then carefully
fitting them as described with suitable bits.</p>

<p>Correct bitting will ensure complete control, or ought to
do so, without inflicting pain. Anything that involves
suffering ought to be discarded—although I do not wish it
to be understood that I object to such pain in bitting as
will compel an unbroken horse to drop his head to the
correct position, or yield to the hands that are training
him. Remember, however, that a curb unduly tightened,
or a bit that is too severe, will often make a horse poke
out his chin—and you must not then drag at him, but
rather give him ease. When an animal has a bit forced
into his mouth that he feels will not suit him, he tries to
<a id="Page_74" href="#Page_74" class="pagenum" title="74"> </a>
tell his master so by all the means that lie within his
power. He exhibits restlessness when the bridle is put on:
gapes, mouths, flings his head about, and carries it (when
urged into motion) either on one side, or unduly high or low.
There is by nature very little so called “vice” in horses.
Comparatively few of them are <em>born</em> unruly, but many
are made so by improper treatment on the part of those
in whose charge they are at times unfortunately placed.</p>

<p>There should be one established law in bitting: never
use <em>any</em> bridle that your horse after a trial will not face.
Were this advice attended to there would be fewer
accidents, and far fewer unsightly exhibitions of danger
and discomfort than we are at present accustomed to see.
A well-placed bit will just clear the tusks in a horse’s
mouth, and in that of a mare will lie one-inch above the
corner teeth. A considerate rider will always look to these
things himself before mounting; will see, for instance, that
the throat-lash is not drawn too tight, and that the pressure
of the bit lies <em>exactly</em> on the bars of the mouth. These
bars are formed much like the <i>tibia</i>, or human shin-bone,
the minor edge being sharper and more salient than the
outer, where it rounds off. Their shape varies in different
horses. In hard-mouthed animals they are round, low,
and furnished abundantly with fleshy substance; in a
tender mouth they are very lean and sharp; and in what
may be styled a good mouth, they are moderately so,
without exhibiting too great an inclination to either of the
first-named conditions.</p>

<p>I like to see a good <em>wide</em> mouthpiece used; it is a vast
<a id="Page_75" href="#Page_75" class="pagenum" title="75"> </a>
deal better to have it too wide than too narrow, and I give
you the advice in case you do not go on the principle of
measurements, which some ridicule. Let your mouthpiece
be at all events not less than five inches inside (and even
this will be found narrow for many horses), with cheeks
rather short, and set <em>outwardly</em>. If a port is used it will
be much better to have it opening laterally, from two to
two and a-half inches.</p>

<p>The unsightly habit of lolling out the tongue arises from
the pressure to which it is, or has been, subjected, by the
whimsical shapes of many of
the mouthpieces in general use,
the ports of which, instead of
being fashioned according to the
form of the tongue and mouth,
are so constructed that the first-named
is either pinched severely
in the hollow, or pressed between
the cannons of the mouthpiece
and the bars of the mouth. The
horse, then, in order to relieve himself from the torture,
either hangs out his tongue, or draws it up above the
mouthpiece: an action which compels him to open his
mouth in an unsightly manner. This latter defect is
likewise frequently attributable to the extreme height of
the ports of some mouthpieces; these act, most improperly,
on the palate, and when the reins are pulled, cause such
excessive agony that the sufferer gapes, in order to ease
his pain.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus-075.jpg" width="322" height="300" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>MOUTH OF TORTURED HORSE.</p></div>
</div>
<a id="Page_76" href="#Page_76" class="pagenum" title="76"> </a>

<p>It is a common error to suppose that the power of the
bit lies in the mouthpiece, according to its form, and that a
high port (one that bears upon the palate) affords control
over the animal thus bitted. The real power lies in the
branches, according to their proportions, and not by any
means in the size or shape of the port, which latter ought
to have the effect of an axis gravitating on the bars of the
mouth, in order that by its influence the branches may act
on these only, and not on either the palate or the tongue.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus-076.jpg" width="306" height="300" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>ANTI-REARING BIT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>No lady’s horse worth
calling one will ever require
a rearing-bit, but such things
are useful on occasions, and a
gentleman told me some time
ago that he obviated an uncomfortable
habit which one
of his horses had contracted,
of throwing up his head, by
using a round ring bit with
reins attached, in place of a
snaffle. I have never tried it myself, therefore cannot
vouch for the general efficacy of the experiment; but it
may be very good. Men do not <em>mean</em> to be cruel to horses
when bitting them improperly, but they are so nevertheless—to
a terrible degree. An animal shows signs of uneasiness,
and it is at once set down to “temper,” and
punished accordingly. Temper may at times no doubt
have something to do with intractability, but so it has—very
often—with ourselves, and what better means can be
<a id="Page_77" href="#Page_77" class="pagenum" title="77"> </a>
adopted to calm the irritability of man or his slave than
patience, kindness, and an entire absence of all desire to
<em>fight</em>?</p>

<p>I do not much care for nosebands; they seem to me to
interfere with the proper action of the bridle, by preventing
the headstall from going forward, and also the cheek of
the bit. The only really useful noseband is one that is
detached from the bridle-cheeks and has a separate crown-strap.
This, when worn low on the nose, is effective
in preventing a horse opening his mouth widely, and
thus displacing the bit from the bars. Martingales I
simply abhor, for hunting purposes, although I have
heard some good authorities advocate the use of the
<em>standing</em> martingale, even when crossing country. I think
it is only allowable in case of a confirmed “star-gazer,”
who goes at his fences with his head in the air, instead
of looking straight before him when he jumps. A
<em>running</em> martingale might be found useful with some
horses for park or road riding, inasmuch as it can be made
effectual for keeping the head of a flippant or unsteady
goer properly in place. When made use of for this
purpose it should be adjusted in such a way as to allow
the pull of the reins to be <em>directly</em> in line with the top
of the withers, and should be lengthened for a horse who
holds his head already sufficiently low.</p>

<p>I have seen Irish horsebreakers in the country improvise
a martingale, by putting the reins underneath
the horse’s neck, and then passing them through two
rings, kept together by a strap. It answered pretty
<a id="Page_78" href="#Page_78" class="pagenum" title="78"> </a>
well for rough riding, but I cannot recommend the innovation.</p>

<p>Martingales of all sorts and descriptions are, as a rule,
undesirable, except when the rings attached to the reins of
them are so small that they cannot by any possibility slip
over those of the bit, and this will necessitate the stitching
of the reins—for buckles will not do. Stops will otherwise
be essential: made of leather, for safety.</p>

<p>I cannot help believing that bitting is generally <em>much</em>
too severely carried out. The most cruel curbs are used
by ignorant persons, whereas there are really very few horses
who cannot be done much more with by dropping the curb
rein altogether, and riding on the snaffle only. Ladies pull
and work their horses’ mouths, and then wonder that
the horses pull them in return. It is a great mistake.
Hundreds of animals are made thoroughly unruly by
undue use of the curb, and so much evil have I seen accrue
from it, that I strongly recommend all young riders to <em>try</em>
riding with the snaffle only, and to keep the curb rein
hanging loosely over the little finger, so that it may in an
instant be taken up if necessity demands, which I am
confident, however, will not very often be the case.</p>

<p>Some time ago I rode a mare for a friend who was very
desirous of ascertaining whether the animal was a fit one to
carry a lady with safety. I don’t believe she meant to
imperil my safety in any way, in order to secure her own.
I simply offered to try the mare, and the proposal was
accepted. Terrible things had been said of the animal’s
want of training, evil temper, and so forth, and the groom
<a id="Page_79" href="#Page_79" class="pagenum" title="79"> </a>
who brought her to me was evidently extremely nervous.
He told me, the very first thing, that the mare had never
in her life done any saddle work, except with “a desperately
wild young gentleman,” who had <em>bitted her severely</em>, and
yet found her most difficult to manage. Therein lay the
secret, I thought to myself; but I said nothing, and the
maligned quadruped and I started on our trial, the groom
most earnestly imploring me to keep a firm hold of the
curb. I found that she hung desperately upon her bridle,
kept her head between her knees with a strong, determined,
heavy pull—a dead one, in fact—upon the bit, and went
along with a rough, jerky action, which had me very soon
tired out. The Editor of the <cite>Sporting and Dramatic News</cite>
had volunteered to accompany me, in order to see the trial,
and when we got into the Row and set our horses going,
the brute nearly dragged my arms out in her canter. The
tug she had upon the bridle was quite terrific, and, evidently
prepared for a fight, she laid back her ears and shook her
wicked head angrily. I rode her from Palace Gate to the
Corner in this manner—not pulling one ounce against her,
and yielding very slightly to her in her stride. By the
time we turned she had given up fighting, and I was enabled
for the first time to speak to my companion. I then
dropped the curb, and rode her entirely upon the snaffle.
The effect was magical; she at once lifted her head, ceased
pulling altogether, and went along in a pleasant, joyous
canter—going well up to her bridle, but not attempting
any liberties whatever. In less than an hour’s time I was
riding her with one hand, petting and making much of her
<a id="Page_80" href="#Page_80" class="pagenum" title="80"> </a>
with the other—an attention which, as a pleasing novelty,
she evidently much appreciated. Finding her slightly
intractable during the ride homeward, I once more lightly
took up the curb. It maddened her in a moment. She
turned wildly round, twisted about with a rotatory motion
most bewildering and unpleasant, ran me against a cart,
and behaved altogether so outrageously that it required my
very utmost skill, confidence, and temper to restore her
equanimity, and steer her safely to our destination. On
dismounting I observed to the groom who had come to
fetch her, that considering the amount of excitement
through which she had passed, it was wonderful that she
had not sweated. His answer was that she was always fed
upon <em>cooked food</em> (a pet theory of mine, to which I shall
devote a chapter by-and-by), and added that the horse
which he himself was riding—a remarkably fine four-year-old—derived
its chief sustenance from <em>boiled barley</em>.</p>

<p>I shall now close my chapter upon bitting. That it has
been a horribly dry one I cannot hope to find contradicted,
but I felt that its instructions ought to come in just where I
have introduced them, and they will be better understood,
no doubt, when the pupil shall have learned thoroughly
how to ride. No lady’s education can be called anything
like complete (with regard to equine matters) until she
perfectly understands the <em>principles</em> of bitting, and can,
moreover, saddle and bridle her own horses without the
aid of a groom. I shall give instructions concerning these
matters in another chapter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<span class="chapter-title">SADDLING.</span></h2>


<p>The choice of a lady’s side-saddle is a most important
matter, and ought not to be treated in any other light; yet
with multitudes of equestrians it seems to be regarded as
almost a thing of nought. “Look out for a second-hand
saddle for me, there’s a dear!” writes a country lady to a
town friend; “I am actually going to ride!” And away
goes the town lady on a search through alley and slum,
and comes home the triumphant purchaser of an awful
instrument, which gives a sore back to the bearer of it in
no time at all, and is then sent to be stuffed, coming back
to its owner all the worse for the process, owing to the
fact that the stuffing has, in the first instance, been
entirely over done. Articles of this description never give
any satisfaction, and would be dear if purchased at half-a-crown.
Economise as you will in other directions—put up
with cheap hats, habits, boots, and gloves, if you cannot
really afford any better,—for, odious though they be, they
can prove injurious to yourself alone,—but let your saddle
be of the best. Go to a first-class maker; get measured
as accurately as a man does for a pair of hunting breeches—tell
him that you need the <em>best</em> materials and very best
<a id="Page_82" href="#Page_82" class="pagenum" title="82"> </a>
workmanship—and if he knows his art he will require no
further directions. It is almost superfluous to repeat that
a well-made side-saddle should be level-seated, and should
have no perceptible dip, or sinking, from front to cantle.
It ought to be amply long for the rider, and the points of
the tree should fit close to the horse’s sides behind the
shoulder-blades. I object to stitching, on either near or
off side, as being unworkmanlike; but an unpractised rider
may have the seat of her saddle covered with buckskin,
which will afford her a more secure grip than she can
obtain from the ordinary slippery leather. The gullet-plate
should either be dispensed with altogether (as mentioned
in a former chapter), or be sufficiently arched to
prevent its pressing on the horse’s withers. I prefer the
former plan, and have found it answer admirably. The up-pommel
should be barely high enough to afford a secure
catch for the right leg. When higher than this it sticks
up like a horn beneath the habit, and is extremely disfiguring.</p>

<p>The leaping-head should be movable. I do not mean
that it should merely turn round and round, or bend downwards
with a hinge, but it ought to be capable of being
placed higher or lower, according as the rider may desire.
This can be accomplished by having two, or even three,
holes made for it within varied distances of one another:
a plan which will be found of especial benefit in cases
where a saddle is purchased with a view to more than one
lady making use of it—and a tired rider will frequently
find it a great boon. Of course, in such case, the leaping-head
<a id="Page_83" href="#Page_83" class="pagenum" title="83"> </a>
must be a screw one, a thing to which I know many
ladies object on the ground that it gets out of order. It
really ought not to do so,—nor does it, except when
entrusted altogether to a groom, who keeps unscrewing it
every day as if for mere pastime. It should not be
touched at all, except when necessary for cleaning purposes,
or to lubricate it with a little oil, and it will be well
then to do it yourself, unless your servant happens to be
an exceptionally good and trustworthy one, or that you
are too grand in your ideas to put your hand to anything
in the shape of work. I hope, however, that I am not
writing for any such silly person. You should never be
above looking after <em>everything</em> connected with your own
riding gear. It will not lessen your dignity one whit:
rather the contrary—for your servants will then see that
you are not a simpleton, and will respect you accordingly.
The lady who shudders at a duster, and wonders where
puddings grow, is in reality not an atom more to be
despised than is the foolish-minded equestrian who thinks
it is inelegant to know anything about the conduct or
management of her own stable. I like to see a woman
able and willing to put her hand to everything that comes
in her way, without feeling in the least lowered by it.
One of the most perfectly ladylike women whom I have
ever met, on one occasion groomed and fed her own
hunter, when the stableman who had charge of him was
found tipsy, on her return one wintry evening from a long
day with the hounds; and she did it, too, before ever
removing her habit. Sense and humanity combined.</p>
<a id="Page_84" href="#Page_84" class="pagenum" title="84"> </a>

<p>I may add, before passing to another portion of my
subject, that where a screw-pommel is used it will be found
a wise plan to have it made with the thread of the screw
<em>reversed</em>; by which I mean that the pommel should turn
from left to right, in place of the ordinary way. By this
arrangement the left knee pressing against it serves to fix
it all the more firmly, instead of, as is usual, misplacing it.</p>

<p>I am often asked what ought to be the weight of a side-saddle,
and what the size. Much must of course depend
upon the dimensions of the rider. About eighteen pounds
is, or ought to be, the average weight of an ordinary saddle,
although my own were much lighter. I do not, however, see
that there is very much to be gained by riding in too light
a saddle. A few pounds one way or the other can make
little difference (except in racing) to a good horse, and
light saddles are sometimes apt to give sore backs.</p>

<p>With regard to size, I consider that a lady of moderate
height—say five feet three, or thereabouts—ought not to
purchase a saddle <em>less</em> than nineteen inches long. Any
good maker will, however, give the proper proportions.</p>

<p>The stirrup-leather of a lady’s saddle is generally attached
to it by an iron ring, but I greatly prefer the spring-bar
attachment, same as is used with men’s saddles. Many
ladies say that it is apt, with pressure, to come away, and
if this be the case, a greater objection could scarcely be
urged against it, but, for my own part, I have never found
it do so.</p>

<p>Peat &amp; Co., of Piccadilly, have brought out and patented
a really first-class article in this line, namely, Born’s
<a id="Page_85" href="#Page_85" class="pagenum" title="85"> </a>
saddle-bar, a contrivance which instantly releases the foot
in case of a rider being either thrown or dragged. I can
confidently recommend it.</p>

<p>A very simple way, which some like, is to have the
stirrup stitched to a single leather, which is then passed
through a ring, and drawn downwards to within an inch
or two of the end of the flap. It is next passed round the
horse’s belly, and buckled to a single tongue on the other
side. This keeps the flaps of the saddle close, and the
rider is enabled by it to shorten or lengthen her stirrup
from the off side—an advantage not to be overlooked.</p>

<p>Girths are of various kinds. Some are in favour of the
elastic webbing; others like the Fitzwilliam, which is a
very excellent kind, and thoroughly to be depended on for
general work. For myself, I strongly advocate the plaited
girths, made of either hide, horsehair, or cord. Being
open-work they admit plenty of air, and are calculated to
prevent chafing.</p>

<p>I do not, as a rule, care for saddle-cloths, but no doubt
they preserve the inside of a saddle very much. If used at
all they ought to be very thin. To save a sore back, a
sheepskin is best A leather saddle-cloth will keep pliant
if in constant use, but if laid by for a while it should be
moistened with a little oil. Cod-liver will be found the
most efficient for the purpose.</p>

<p>I am not in favour of <em>any</em> of the so-called safety stirrups.
Nicholl’s patent is the best of them; but I cannot help
regarding them all as danger-traps, having twice nearly lost
my life through using them. I therefore strongly recommend
<a id="Page_86" href="#Page_86" class="pagenum" title="86"> </a>
all lady riders to adopt a perfectly plain stirrup,
such as is used by men, only of course smaller. A neat
little racing stirrup served me faithfully for years, and I
cannot advocate any other. Safety stirrups are perpetually
getting out of order, and my experience of even the best
of them is that they are liable to catch the foot and
confine it in a dangerous manner, which the plain stirrup
never does.</p>

<p>To ride with a slipper, even for a very young beginner, is
strongly to be condemned. To allow children to use it is
simply to train them to ride <em>from</em> it—thus sowing the
seeds of a most pernicious practice. It feels so snug and
comfortable under the foot that there is an irresistible
desire to rest and dwell upon it: an evil of which I shall
hereafter have occasion to speak.</p>

<p>Having now said all that I consider useful concerning
saddles and bridles, I think it will be expedient to give a
few instructions about putting them on; for, as I have
already said, a lady or gentleman who cannot do this
without the aid of a servant has yet (no matter how
accomplished in every other way) something very important
to learn.</p>

<p>To bridle a horse, go quietly up to him, holding the
headstall in your hand. Make much of him for a moment
or two before putting it on: not at all because you think
that he is going to fight against it—no lady’s horse would
be guilty of doing such a thing—but because it is a nice
and right habit, and one to be put in practice upon every
reasonable occasion. The way in which unthinking grooms
<a id="Page_87" href="#Page_87" class="pagenum" title="87"> </a>
drag poor horses’ heads about, and <em>force</em> heavy bits into
their quiet, unresisting mouths, is enough to make a humane
heart feel grieved and angry together. Gentleness is,
however, a woman’s attribute, and the kindness with which
most women usually regard animals is one of their most
loveable traits.</p>

<p>When the headstall has been nicely fitted, take a glance
over it, and note that the forehead-band is loose enough,
and that the throat-lash will admit at least two of your
fingers between it and the skin. Fit the snaffle-rein next,
by the buckles, and see that it falls about half an inch below
the angle of the mouth. If you are in the habit of riding
with a curb, adjust it very carefully, observing the rule laid
down in my chapter on bitting, of resting the mouth-piece
on <em>the bars</em> of the mouth, just above the chin-groove. I
know it occasionally happens that some irregularity about
the teeth renders this a difficult thing to do, and where
such is the case the bit must of course be slightly moved,
but it ought to be placed only just as much above the
obstacle as will be necessary to clear it. You must next
hook the curb, taking the off side first, and leaving a link
in reserve. Then come to the near side, and leave it length
enough to afford two links—making sure also that it lies
quite flat on the chin-groove, and has not the smallest
tendency to rise upwards at the draw of the reins.
Ascertain above all things that the chain is sufficiently
slack, and that it does not inconvenience the horse. A good
test will be for you to insert the first and second fingers of
your left hand between it and the animal’s chin: slipping
<a id="Page_88" href="#Page_88" class="pagenum" title="88"> </a>
them in, so that the palm of your hand shall go beneath
the under lip of the horse, and the back portion of your two
fingers be exposed to the pressure of the chain; then draw
the reins quietly with your right hand, and if you feel an
unpleasant pinching, slacken the chain a link, and try
again until you have it right. I said in my last chapter
that the action of the mouth-piece on the bars of the mouth
was entirely controlled by the branches, which also regulate
that of the curb-chain, both on chin and bars. The
pressure which it effects on these constrains the horse to
obey the will of his rider. Now, when the curb-chain is
left to hang in too loose a fashion, the pressure cannot be
effected at all, and the branches go backwards, because
they meet with no resistance from the curb-chain: and
thus the action of the cannons on the bars of the mouth
is altogether defeated.</p>

<p>Saddling comes next to be spoken about. Place the saddle
clear of the play of the shoulders, if meant for hunting;
when the adjustment is for ordinary riding, an inch or two
further back will do. It is a common error to place the
saddle out of position, in order to make it appear as if the
horse bridled better, or had a finer shoulder than he really
has; but it is a very wrong thing to practice constantly,
and can only deceive the most inexperienced judge’s eye.</p>

<p>If you want a horse to go particularly fast for a short
distance, you may adjust the saddle so that it shall be as
far forward as possible without interfering with his action:
as the chief office of the hinder part of an animal is to
propel weight, while that of the fore part is to bear it up.</p>
<a id="Page_89" href="#Page_89" class="pagenum" title="89"> </a>

<p>When the saddle has been nicely placed, take up the first
girth, and then the hinder one, drawing both well back
from the horse’s elbows, so that they shall neither chafe nor
inconvenience him in his action. Do not girth him up too
tightly at first, especially if he has been recently fed; nor
must you on the other hand leave him too much space for
the air to make way through, taking into account that
some horses are terrible rogues, and will actually swell
themselves out ever so much when they feel the girths
tightening upon them, which shows that they are more
sensible than many who ride them, inasmuch as they
object to being too tightly laced. I had an arrant rogue
once, who used to present the appearance of a drowned pup
whenever I came to girth him up, and would gradually
collapse inward, like an indiarubber ball with a hole in it,
whenever he thought he had me sufficiently gammoned.
That horse’s face would have won a fortune for him as a
type of injured innocence when I let him see one day in a
practical manner that I was up to his tricks; but we continued
excellent chums, nevertheless, and as it was to a
male friend I subsequently sold him (who would, of course,
clap a leg each side of him, and so distribute the weight),
I said nothing about his little dodges, but laughed to
myself when, a few days later, I saw the dear old man (his
owner) riding his wily purchase in the Row, with girths so
slack that he could have put both feet into them, stirrups
and all, without much inconvenience, and my cunning friend
trotting demurely along under him, with the most lamb-like
countenance in the world.</p>
<a id="Page_90" href="#Page_90" class="pagenum" title="90"> </a>

<p>It is almost unnecessary to say that while tight girthing
is for every reason to be avoided, it will not do at all to
leave the girths of a lady’s saddle too loose. When they
are so, the uneven distribution of weight which a side
position necessarily entails will be sure to draw the saddle
on one side, or perhaps even cause it to turn: in which
case the consequences will be both dangerous and unpleasant.</p>

<p>I think it an excellent plan to lead a horse about by
the bridle for a minute or two after girthing, and then
try again whether he is tight enough, by inserting a hand
between the girths and the belly, and seeing whether they
need any further looking after.</p>

<p>I must not omit to say that if you are using a saddle-cloth
or sheepskin, you should, before finally girthing up,
draw the front part of it well forward on the withers, in
order that the gullet-plate of the saddle (if that article
happens to be made with one) may not press upon them.</p>

<p>The last thing for you to do before mounting will be to
pass your forefinger under the girths at each side of the
horse’s body, and smooth away any wrinkles that the
action of girthing may have caused in his skin.</p>

<p>It will not be amiss here to say that many ladies have
asked me for an opinion concerning the advisability of
riding occasionally on the left or off side of the horse. I
cannot see any objection whatever to it for ordinary riding,
although I cannot advocate it for hunting; and where
young girls find it expedient to ride a good deal, I should
be apt to recommend it highly, as a means of preventing
<a id="Page_91" href="#Page_91" class="pagenum" title="91"> </a>
their growing awry. The saddle necessary for it is a somewhat
awkward-looking article to those unaccustomed to
view such things, but it may be satisfactory to know that
the Princess of Wales rarely uses any other kind.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<span class="chapter-title">LEARNING TO RIDE.<br />

HOW TO SIT—TO WALK—TO CANTER—AND TO TROT.</span></h2>


<p>Being now provided with a fully-caparisoned mount, it is
time that you should begin in good earnest to learn to ride;
therefore to this pleasant task we will apply ourselves,
reserving the interesting subjects of shoeing, feeding,
stabling, &amp;c., for future consideration.</p>

<p>To mount well must first be studied, and practised: the
latter assiduously, no matter how great the drudgery may
be. It is certainly disheartening to a learner to feel that
one of the most trying portions of her equine education is
after all the only one that involves a very serious drawback,
namely, that of requiring assistance that cannot well be
done without; yet, so it is—and the difficulty is one which
must be considered and met. A lady may saddle and
bridle her own horse, may give him the finishing touches
herself, and canter away, independently, when once she is
on his back—but to get there she must, as a rule, seek for
assistance from some source or another, and <em>animated</em>
sources (by which I mean men) are generally painfully
inefficient. It certainly is what is expressively termed
“hard lines” on a practised equestrian to be made an
<a id="Page_93" href="#Page_93" class="pagenum" title="93"> </a>
exhibition of at door or covert-side by some inexpert
individual, who either sends her clean over the saddle by
the superfluous energy of his action, or leaves her to hang
fire midway while he stoops to pick up his hat, which he
manages to lose through stupidly poking his head forward
at the moment at which she is making her spring. I know
exactly what it is, and the mortification that it entails.
Many of us are, unfortunately, familiar with the feeling
that we have done precisely the right thing ourselves, but
that some officious and horribly incompetent assistant—or
would-be such—has frustrated our efforts, and left us
a laughing-stock in the centre of a crowd. It is just like
going up to a piano in full possession of all the difficulties
that may mark the song selected to be sung, and being
compelled to undergo the torments inflicted by a bad accompanist,
who handicaps the singer by his own utter unfitness
for his task. Half the people present are not able to
discern whether it is the voice or the piano that is at fault;
they only know that the performance is a failure, and speak
of it afterwards as such. So it is with mounting for a
ride. Say that there are a hundred persons present at a
lawn meet, and you emerge from the house to mount your
horse, with the result that you are kept struggling for an
awful moment or two betwixt the ground and the saddle
by some blushing booby who has offered to put you up, and
who will neither do so properly nor suffer you to jump quite
down. At least two-thirds of the onlookers will be ready
to say the fault is yours. My advice, therefore, is, never
leave yourself open to an unpleasantness of this description;
<a id="Page_94" href="#Page_94" class="pagenum" title="94"> </a>
select your assistant cavalier, just as you have a right to
accept or reject a partner for a dance—and if nobody in
whom you have confidence happens to be present, have
recourse to the groom’s assistance, if you are quite certain
that he knows how to render it, and, if not, lead your
horse to a low wall, should such a thing be near enough, or
take him, at all events, out of sight of the crowd, and utilise
<em>any</em> sort of stepping-stone to reach his back, rather than
incur the ridicule or unjust remarks of the more fortunate
among your sex.</p>

<p>It is, of course, in some cases, quite possible for a lady to
let down her stirrup and mount by it, unassisted—drawing
it up again to the required length when seated on her
saddle. To little girls riding ponies I have already recommended
this plan; but for grown equestrians it is far more
frequently impracticable than otherwise. A lady rider
may be of diminutive stature, and may yet be called upon
to mount a very tall horse; or her stirrup may not be an
easily movable one (say, for instance, that she is accepting
a ride upon a borrowed mount, with trappings entirely
unlike her own), or her habit-bodice, despite all warnings,
may not be loose enough about the waist to enable her to
make the long stretch up to the pommel which unassisted
mounting always requires. Therefore, writers who say that
a lady can at <em>all</em> times be entirely independent of extraneous
assistance prove to a certainty that they have not
studied the subject.</p>

<p>The orthodox method of mounting is as follows: Take
the reins and whip in your right hand and lay the fingers
<a id="Page_95" href="#Page_95" class="pagenum" title="95"> </a>
of it firmly upon the top of the up-pommel—grasping it,
in fact; then, with your left hand, gather your skirt away
from your left foot, and place this latter in the hand of your
assistant, bending your knee as you do so. When you feel
that his palm is firmly supporting the sole of your foot, take
your left hand from your habit-skirt and place it on his left
shoulder—he being in a slightly stooping position at the time.
Then give him the signal: any pre-arranged word will do—“Ready!”
“Go ahead!” “Now!” or, in short, anything
you may choose to fix. As you say the word, straighten
your knee, and make a slight spring upward, your cavalier
at the same instant raising himself to an erect position,
without letting his hand drop in the very smallest degree.
By this arrangement you will reach your saddle with
comfort and expertness. It will, as already mentioned,
require some patient practice, for, like many other accomplishments,
it looks wonderfully simple and easy—until
you come to try it. In the event of having to mount by a
wall, a big stone, a horse-bucket, or other article—any one
of which you may be glad at some time or another to make
use of on emergency—steady yourself well upon your
stepping-stone, whatever it may be, gather the reins in
your <em>left</em> hand, laying it firmly upon the up-pommel or on
the horse’s mane, place your foot in the stirrup, taking care
that it is well freed from the habit-skirt, then seize the
cantle firmly with your right hand, and jump into the
saddle. If your skirt is properly cut, you will have no
difficulty in arranging it comfortably over your right knee
when the latter has been placed in position, and you
<a id="Page_96" href="#Page_96" class="pagenum" title="96"> </a>
should then lift yourself slightly, and smooth the seat of
the skirt from right to left with your left hand, first transferring
the reins and whip to your right, in order to enable
you to do so.</p>

<p>You should be extremely careful, if wearing a spur, to
keep your left heel <em>well</em> away from the horse’s side when
mounting: otherwise, the consequences may be very
disastrous. I once saw a lady thrown heavily upon her
face by a sudden start of her horse, through her spur
having struck him in the flank just as she reached the
saddle, before she had time to secure the support of the
pommels.</p>

<p>Be cautious, also, not to touch your horse, when mounting,
with your whip. If you do so he will assuredly start,
and may give you an ugly fall. It is for this reason that I
advocate the custom of ladies when mounting retaining
the whip in their right hand and placing it, together with
the reins, on the up-pommel of the saddle, in place of, as
many do, handing it to their assistant cavalier. A man, when
he gets a lady’s whip to hold, naturally tucks it away under
his arm, where a nervous horse keeps looking askance at it,
and is often rendered fidgetty by seeing it, even when it
does not actually touch him—although it very often does.
I append two sketches, one showing the correct position
of the hand with whip and reins upon the pommel
when just about to mount, the other demonstrating the
precise attitude in which a lady ought to seat herself upon
the saddle.</p>

<p>If properly placed, and sitting erect and even, your seat
<a id="Page_97" href="#Page_97" class="pagenum" title="97"> </a>
ought to be as secure as that of a man, or even more so,
although you may have to depend (which no doubt you
will) upon the girths for safety, and also to submit to the
disadvantage of not having a leg on each side of your horse
to guide him or urge him to his paces. A clever rider will,
however, make her whip-handle serve her in great measure
for this.</p>

<p>Be careful, when seated, to keep the toe of the right
<a id="Page_98" href="#Page_98" class="pagenum" title="98"> </a>
foot from pointing outward, and the left heel from going
back—and look right between your horse’s ears, to ensure
sitting straight.</p>

</div>

<p>When you have once obtained a correct idea of position,
you should seek to acquire what is termed “a good seat”—in
other words, an easy confidence, which will add grace to
your pose. I am now surmising that you are teaching
yourself—say, in a large field, or private school—and that
you have not anybody with you, save, perhaps, some male
friend or relative, who may be capable of assisting you
if required—without, however, being able to instruct. I
<a id="Page_99" href="#Page_99" class="pagenum" title="99"> </a>
cannot for a moment advise you to go out <em>alone</em> for the
purpose of learning, no matter how high-couraged you
may be. Always enlist the services of a suitable companion,
or attendant, but remember that if the latter is a servant—even
though his service may be of many years’ standing—you
are not on any account to permit him to give you
so much as the very smallest hint on any subject connected
with equitation. Coachmen know nothing at all about
riding; and grooms, as a rule, very little: a fact that is
every day testified by their heavy hands and awkward gait
on horseback. Laying all this aside, however, there can
be no doubt that whatever hints servants may be capable
of imparting to boy pupils, they are the very worst possible
instructors for girls, while pretending very often to be the
best. I attribute one-half the faults in style which shock
our eyes in park, street, and hunting-field, to the pernicious
teachings of “John the groom”; therefore, the moment
that such persons attempt to open their lips to you, except
when spoken to, shut them up at once, in a manner which
(without any rudeness) will show that you desire them to
keep silent except when addressed.</p>

<p>As soon as you are secure upon your saddle, and have
learned to feel at home there, get your horse walked about
with the reins looped over his neck. Do not touch them at
all at first, or trouble yourself about carrying a whip, but
rather devote your energies and attention to acquiring an
<em>even balance</em>, and learning the proper grip of the pommels—without
which you never can ride well. Do not lean
heavily upon the stirrup, or force yourself to undue
<a id="Page_100" href="#Page_100" class="pagenum" title="100"> </a>
muscular action; nor will it be in all cases wise to thrust
the left foot “home,” as it is called,—better ride from the
ball of it. Further reference to this point will be found in
the concluding chapter.</p>

<p>Ascertain before starting that your stirrup-leather is
precisely the right length, in order that you may not be
induced to lean to the left side owing to its being too long,
or have your knee uncomfortably thrust up on account
of its shortness. You should sit erect and square, with
chest forward and shoulders well back, yet without any
appearance of stiffness or rigidity of position. Be as firm
as a rock <em>below</em> the waist, but light and flexible as a reed
above it. On these two rules all the beauty, and indeed
the safety, of equestrianism depend.</p>

<p>You must practice hard to attain a good, <em>steady</em> seat, for
it will not come to you by magic. On the contrary, you will
find yourself at one moment sitting as stiff as a poker, with
your chin thrust forward in the air—and then, when you catch
yourself thus, and strive to rectify it by assuming a sudden
limpness, you will discover that your lower limbs have grown
limp also, in sympathy with the rest of your body, and are
hanging so loosely that a touch will send you out of the
saddle. Again, you will discover that the toe of your right
foot has a dreadful tendency to turn outward from the
ankle, while that of the left turns down, and shows the
sole of your boot to those in the rear of you.</p>

<p>All these things will be seemingly against you for a long
time after you have begun to have your horse led about: a
process which must be done first by hand and then with a

leading-stick, while you sit perfectly erect, with your arms
crossed upon your bosom, or your hands lying easily
(fingers laid together) in your lap, just below the waist.
Avoid, above all things, sitting too much to the left; it will
not only induce you to lean too hard upon the stirrup, a
thing which you ought not to do at all, but will be pretty
certain to give your horse a tender back from the very
beginning.</p>

<p>When you find that you can sit quite straight and
steady while your mount carries you at a walking pace,
you may have him led by a lunging-rein, and cantered
slowly in a circle to the right, or in a figure of 8. Never
on any account grip the pommels, or clutch at the mane,
no matter how frightened you may be. A little start
will not upset you, nor will a sudden playful movement
have the power to send you off, provided that you are
sitting “square,” with your right leg well pressed over the
up-pommel, and your left against the leaping-head, while
your whole attention is given to your seat, and to nothing
else whatever. This is the true secret of learning to ride
from balance, and once it is yours, nothing can unseat you,
so long as your mount remains upon his legs.</p>

<p>Cantering is not a difficult motion by any means. When
attempting it your attendant should make your horse lead
with the off fore-leg, although, should it be your intention
to ride occasionally on the left side of the saddle, you must
accustom him to lead now and again with the near.
Sit well back, and when your mount moves in a circle, lean
just sufficiently to the right to enable you to see his feet.</p>
<a id="Page_102" href="#Page_102" class="pagenum" title="102"> </a>

<p>When you are at home in the canter you must commence
to practice the trot, which will be to you the
beginning of sorrows. Do not at first make any effort at
rising in your saddle, but sit very close, and prepare to
bear the unpleasantness of the bumping—for it must be
borne for awhile—until you have become accustomed to
the motion. As you will of course have your hair flowing
loosely, and a wide easy-fitting jacket on, you will suffer
fewer discomforts than if differently apparelled.</p>

<p>To rise in the saddle, you must keep the left heel well
down, and move the leg as little as possible. To sway it
like a pendulum will not help you one bit. Keep your
hands perfectly steady—your arms to your sides—your left
foot slightly pressing the stirrup as the horse throws out
his near fore leg, while you lift yourself very slightly at the
precise instant that his other leg is advanced. It will take
you a long while to accomplish this. Over and over again
you will sigh with disappointment, and say involuntarily,
“I cannot do it!” But you can, and will in time, if you will
only persevere. Few things that are worth learning can be
acquired in a hurry; a young robust girl, with plenty of
courage and go about her, will often learn how to “stick
on” in an incredibly short space of time—but will look
supremely ridiculous notwithstanding, both then and later;
to acquire the <em>niceties</em> of riding, however, and become an
adept at them, is a degree of perfection to which comparatively
few ladies ever attain. The accomplishment of
rising and falling nicely in the saddle, in time to the trot
of the horse, can only be acquired by constant practice;
<a id="Page_103" href="#Page_103" class="pagenum" title="103"> </a>
I do not believe that the fact of having a master riding
alongside of you, and saying “one, two,” “one, two,” until
you are half demented, will ever teach it, although steady
perseverance on your own part may, and will.</p>

<div class="figcenter w450">

  <p class="right"><i><a href="#Page_103">page 103</a>.</i></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>There are three things that I want you particularly to
avoid. First, an ugly churning movement, which is hideous
to look at and distressing to the horse; second, a disposition
to ride with your elbows extended, or your left
hand on hip or thigh, or placed at the back of your waist;
and third, a habit of stooping forward in the trot and
hanging over to the near side, a fault which is extremely
usual with lady riders. I give an illustration of this unsightly
position, by way of warning; supplemented by one
of a figure seated correctly upon the saddle, while her horse
is trotting at the rate of eight or nine miles an hour.</p>

<p>As soon as you are perfectly mistress of the art of
riding gracefully from balance, and can walk, canter, and
trot, both fast and slowly, without any assistance save that
which your grip of the pommels and <em>slight</em> help from the
stirrup combine to afford you, the latter adjunct may be
discarded altogether for awhile, and you may ride for an
hour or so every day without it. You will not take
very long to practice this; indeed, the only inconvenience
arising from it, at all worth considering, will be a certain
tired feeling in the left leg, as though the limb wanted
dreadfully to have something to support it—but, believe
me, a very few days of steady practice will enable you to
dispense with stirrup aid altogether, and not to feel at all
incommoded by doing so. In a week’s time at furthest you
<a id="Page_104" href="#Page_104" class="pagenum" title="104"> </a>
will be able to ride quite as easily without the stirrup as
with it—and surely, even were it to involve a month’s hard
labour, the result would prove ample remuneration. If you
mean to be a huntress, there will assuredly be days when
your hardly-earned accomplishment will stand you in good
stead, for never yet was there a straight-going lady who did
not at some time or another break a stirrup leather, or lose
one, or find herself in some way or another deprived,
through accident, of the support to which so many horsewomen
unfortunately trust. It often happens, too, that the
misfortune occurs at a provokingly long distance from
home, and miles away, perhaps, from any place where
repairs can be executed; therefore, the advantage (in this
respect alone) of learning to ride without a stirrup must
be at once apparent: to say nothing of the great benefits
derivable from having taught yourself complete independence
of any <em>support</em> from it—a thing which always ensures
an erect and perfect seat.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />

<span class="chapter-title">REINS, VOICE, AND WHIP.</span></h2>


<p>When you have decided to your own satisfaction that you
are mistress of the art of riding from balance—can trot and
canter in circles, and in a figure of 8, without reins or
stirrup, with waist pliant and nicely hollowed, and shoulders
well thrown back—you may, with advantage, take up the
reins and learn the uses of them.</p>

<p>Learners, to whom I have endeavoured to expound this
theory of teaching, have asked me once or twice whether
there was not some less difficult way by which they might
be taught; and I have no doubt that many among my
lady readers are longing to ask me the same question.
Certainly there is; in fact there are several ways which
will be found very much less difficult than the one that I
am striving to teach. Hosts of riding-masters will engage to
perfect you (or very nearly so) in six lessons—will put you
on a horse, give you a stirrup and a stout pair of reins, and
adjure you volubly to “hold on,” taking very little further
trouble about you; and if you are a plucky, intelligent girl
you <em>will</em> hold on, and will canter and trot too, in a sort of
way, within the specified time,—and your instructor will take
your money with a smile, and allow you to go out into the
<a id="Page_106" href="#Page_106" class="pagenum" title="106"> </a>
park and make a show of yourself, until some really kind
disinterested friend warns you that things are entirely
wrong, and persuades you to go and unlearn all that has
already been taught you.</p>

<p>There are just two ways of doing everything in this
world—the right and the wrong, and the latter is always,
unfortunately, very much the easier of the two, although
so much the more unsatisfying in the end. I am quite
willing to acknowledge that some very nice horsewomen
have learned all that they know of riding without ever
having gone through one-half the labour which I have set
forth as necessary; but those four little words, “all that
they know,” contain the whole meaning of the matter. I
am willing to allow, also, that there are prodigies in the
world—at riding as at everything else—who can look nice,
and go straight, and seemingly do nothing amiss, and who
yet have never been taught to ride at all; but these are
uncommon creatures, quite beyond the study of books on
horsemanship, or on anything else. They form, in fact,
the exceptions to the rule, that ladies who have learned
to ride in the ordinary way and from ordinary teachers, do
<em>not</em> ride well, or correctly; and that even in cases where their
appearance on horseback is fairly satisfactory, and their
park riding quite as good as many others, the efforts made
by them at cross-country riding are miserable, and dangerous
to a degree. Balance-riders can alone negotiate a difficult
country with safety. Hundreds of ladies get serious falls
every season over the difficult doubles of our trying Ward
country and the ragged fences of old Kildare, which they
<a id="Page_107" href="#Page_107" class="pagenum" title="107"> </a>
would never get had they in the first instance been properly
taught. Therefore, being desirous, as I truly am, that all
my lady readers shall excel at an art which is so well worth
studying, I have laid down the best practical directions for
their instruction, in the hope that they may accept and
profit by them; and I promise fearlessly that by so doing
they will be in the first flight when others are on the roadside,
and in the saddle when those who trust for safety to
rein and stirrup are exploring the slimy depths of some
uncomfortable ditch.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Having now arrived at the question of holding the reins,
we shall consider their uses and abuses from a common-sense
point of view. You are not to regard them in any
degree as a means of preserving your own equilibrium—this
I have already taught you. To ride from a horse’s
head is one of the gravest faults of which an equestrian can
be guilty; nor must you depend altogether upon the bridle
for the management of your mount, this is a very general
error, and one that I want you strictly to avoid. Horses
are controlled by three things: the reins, the voice, and the
legs—and a lady rider must make her whip-handle serve
her for the management and guidance of her mount on the
off side, where a man has the advantage of having his
right leg to assist him in the office. Of this more anon, for
I mean to touch lightly upon the three controlling powers.</p>

<p>First, the reins. Teachers of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">haute école</i> style of
riding may possibly have told you wonders about military
horsemanship, and how the movements of an animal may be
regulated by certain subtle touches of the thumb or little
<a id="Page_108" href="#Page_108" class="pagenum" title="108"> </a>
finger. I must candidly say that I don’t believe a word of
their efficacy for general-purpose riding. I do not think
that a learner could ever be brought to understand such
theories from printed rules, or to profit by them if understood.
Put a girl, for instance, on a high-mettled hunter,
loop the reins over the fingers of her left hand only—as
fashionable riding-masters do in schools—give her the whip,
pointed upwards (another general symptom of defective
teaching) in her right hand, and then send her out, not
over the smooth grass fields and through the convenient
gates of beautiful Leicestershire, where, a few years ago,
a whole day’s hunting might be had without having to jump
a single fence, but away over the rugged plough and trying
ridge-and-furrow which take the wind out of our Irish
hunters. The high stone walls of Galway hunting-fields
are excellent tests of skill; so also are the five-barred gates
of Meath and Carlow, and the yawning chasms—sixteen
feet wide and twenty deep—at which we in this hapless
yet lovely old country have to steady our horses when
coming up, and support them when over, or else lie gasping
at the bottom, with broken ribs and damaged noses, and
dreadful saddle-pommels making havoc with our frames at
every struggle of our engulfed and terrified steeds. Send,
I say, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">haute école</i> rider out over Irish hunting-grounds,
and see what good she can accomplish with the little finger
of her left hand! Such teaching is a mere tirade of ornamental
nonsense, for which, I believe, no pupil would in
the end feel at all obliged.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>REINS: TWO HANDS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I approve of taking the reins in both hands from the very
<a id="Page_109" href="#Page_109" class="pagenum" title="109"> </a>
beginning. It is a sensible method: one which all colt-breakers
adopt, and they are not bad judges of such matters.
Ladies, however, rarely adopt the practice; it is not allowed
in many of the most approved schools—but, in my opinion,
“Put both hands to your bridle” is excellent premonitory
advice. Begin by riding with a bridoon, or snaffle rein,
only. Let your fingers lie above it—not underneath,—the
thumbs pointing toward one another, at a distance of about
three or four inches apart, the off leather resting between
the third and little fingers of the right hand, while the
slack of the near passes between the first finger and the
thumb. The illustration will show you what I mean, and
demonstrate how by this rule both hands have equal command
upon the bridle.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus-110-2.jpg" width="500" height="280" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>AT A FENCE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>To shorten your reins quickly: let go the slack of the <em>off</em>
one with the left hand, and slip it forward on the <em>near</em>
leather, until you have judged (rapidly, of course) of the
correct length; then take the off one between the thumb
<a id="Page_110" href="#Page_110" class="pagenum" title="110"> </a>
and forefinger of the left hand, and you establish a <em>cross-rein</em>,
the right hand quitting its hold <em>instantly</em>, and taking
up its original position. I append an illustration of my
meaning, and strongly advise a little practice of it, which
can be readily managed even in the house, by utilising
tape or ribbon reins attached to the back of a chair. The
method thus described is an admirable one for shortening
a single bridle when coming up, say, to a fence at which a
horse may require some holding; and I likewise append a
<a id="Page_111" href="#Page_111" class="pagenum" title="111"> </a>
little sketch of how the bridle ought to hang, and the
hands be held, when going over.</p>

<p>When you want to ride leisurely, in park or on road,
with the reins in one hand only—a thing at times not
at all to be deprecated—draw the near rein between the
third and little fingers of your left hand, and bring it out
between the first and thumb, while the off one is made to
cross it in the palm of the hand, thus:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus-111-1.jpg" width="500" height="199" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>REINS IN ONE HAND—FIRST POSITION.</p></div>
</div>

<p class="continued">Then turn the hand with the knuckles <em>upward</em>, as here
represented,</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus-111-2.jpg" width="500" height="277" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>REINS IN ONE HAND—SECOND POSITION.</p></div>
</div>

<p class="continued">and a correct position will be ensured.</p>

<p>You should avoid working the fingers about when
<a id="Page_112" href="#Page_112" class="pagenum" title="112"> </a>
riding, as doing so is very apt to shift the bit in the
horse’s mouth. Your hand may go back and forth with
a “give-and-take” movement, but not from side to side on
any account.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus-112.jpg" width="500" height="422" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>REINS FIRMLY IN BOTH HANDS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The best method of riding with double reins can, I think,
be most effectually shown by illustration. This represents
the reins held firmly, though not tightly, in both hands;
while that on the next page shows an easy style of going—one
that is nice to adopt when proceeding at a walking
pace. When trotting, the reins may be dropped by the
right hand, which should then be lowered to the level of
the saddle—the whip pointing <em>downwards</em>.</p>

<p>If you wish to ride with one rein only, though with a
<a id="Page_113" href="#Page_113" class="pagenum" title="113"> </a>
double bridle, hold the snaffle rein in your left hand in
the manner already described, and loop the curb over your
little finger, in order that it may be readily taken up when
required.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus-113.jpg" width="500" height="417" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>WALKING PACE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I may here say that, despite the directions which I
have taken pains to give on the subject of holding reins
I adhere to the belief that so long as they are held flat and
smooth, there need not really be any <em>fixed rule</em> about the
handling of them. If elbows, shoulders, and wrists are in
proper position, it matters comparatively little how fingers
may be held—and beginners are, as a rule, a great deal too
much worried and puzzled about a matter which generally
<a id="Page_114" href="#Page_114" class="pagenum" title="114"> </a>
simplifies itself according as a knowledge of more important
things is acquired. At the same time, there is with
this, as with everything else, a right and a wrong side to
the subject; and in order to avoid the wrong, it will
perhaps be as well to adopt the orthodox right method
from the very beginning. There is, however, nothing at
all wrong in occasionally moving the reins about and
changing them from one hand to the other. All good
riders do it, and it is vastly better than adopting the stiff,
set style which would-be fine riders sometimes affect:
namely, placing the hands in one position when setting out,
and scarcely ever altering them from it. A good horsewoman
will sedulously avoid everything that is stiff or ungraceful,
and will move about in her saddle with as much
pliant ease as though seated at home in an easy chair.
The unsightly rigidity observable about the figures and
demeanour of some lady-riders—especially those whose
“teaching” has been too finely drawn—is certainly not a
thing to be copied or admired.</p>

<p>Having now discussed the subject of reins, we come
to consider the “Voice” as a means of controlling and
managing the horse.</p>

<p>I have always considered the effect and power of the voice
as second only in usefulness to those of the bridle. Horses
are intelligent and sensitive beyond what most persons can
be induced to think or believe. I know to a certainty that
they not only listen to, and are influenced by, every sound
that issues from their riders’ lips, but absolutely gather his
meaning and desires from the various inflexions of his
<a id="Page_115" href="#Page_115" class="pagenum" title="115"> </a>
voice. I know that they love their masters and mistresses,
and look to them for teaching, just as dependent children
ask you what it is that you wish them to do. There is
something inexpressibly beautiful in this loving intelligence
on the part of animals—this sympathy between horse
and rider, which, in a former chapter, I strove to say
something about. Horses are in reality the very noblest of
God’s created things—excepting, of course, man <em>as he ought
to be</em>. They have, so far as their endowments permit, all
the attributes that go to make the human character lovable
and good, supplemented by a rare fidelity, such as is unhappily
seldom met with among those who are fashioned
in the Creator’s own image. I have read, and been told a
great deal, about horses that were “obstinate brutes,” and
“wicked devils,” and “outrageous beasts,” and everything
else that was hateful and bad—and have listened with a
bursting and indignant heart to accounts of thrashings, and
starvings, and spurrings, and mouth-burnings, and other
wickednesses, which have made me feel how infinitely
superior was the so-called brute creation to that which it is
made to serve. I confess that it has not been my lot to
come across any specimens of this much-talked-of vicious
sort, excepting in one or two rare instances, where I knew
that vice had been engendered by bad and cruel treatment.
I have no doubt that horses, like human beings, are
sometimes born with evil natures—<em>sometimes</em>, but not very
often. I have not met with any of them, and the few with
whom I have ever had trouble have invariably been those
whom wanton cruelty or rank injustice had in the first
<a id="Page_116" href="#Page_116" class="pagenum" title="116"> </a>
instance spoilt. There are very few horses indeed—even
the most unruly—that cannot be tamed, or made amenable
and obedient, by the hands and <em>voice</em> of a kind and judicious
trainer, and for this sort of work women are especially
fitted. I mean, of course, women of courage and mind;
not such as would scream at sight of a spider, or go into
fits if a mouse chanced to cross the floor. A woman’s
voice carries great power along with it, and the touch of
her light firm hands can effect things at which a man’s
would utterly fail. Gentleness goes ever in advance of
force, and leading is preferable to driving. Even if you
have to scold, or whip, there is a way of doing both that is
temperate and wise, and that will never create ill-will
between you and your horse. Fight an animal, and he will
fight you in return; coax him by the gentleness of your
action and the sound of your voice, and he will be pretty
certain to yield. It is just the difference between “lead”
and “drive.” Such, at least, has been my experience.</p>

<p>I saw a horse some time ago in the west of Ireland,
caged like a wild beast, and fed with a pitchfork through
the bars of his door. Nobody would go near him, he bore
such a bad name, and the appellation his groom bestowed
upon him—“A tattherin’ divil!”—was certainly more
expressive than refined. I offered to buy him; his owner
said I might have him for nothing; but I gave what I
thought fair, and took the horse home. The creature was
wild from savage treatment. He had known nothing but
blows and threats, and angry epithets: things that he had
learned to understand only too well, and was, seemingly
<a id="Page_117" href="#Page_117" class="pagenum" title="117"> </a>
ever expectant of, and waiting for. I taught him something
different—and how?—by the simple power of my voice.
It is not a particularly musical one, by any means, except
in the ears of animals, but to one of these it has never yet
uttered an angry word,—and the horse came to know it,
and to listen for it, and to neigh at the sound of it, and by-and-by
we got to understand one another quite well, and
the great, big, foolish old head, all defaced and disfigured as
it was by hard knocks and bad usage, used to rest lovingly
upon my shoulder, while I stroked the ears that in former
days had so often been laid back in angry vindictiveness
against a harsh and cruel task-master. “He’ll take the
nose off your face some day, the treacherous brute!” an ex-attendant
upon my new pet once said to me. But, needless
to say, it was a libel: my nose is still intact. The horse
learned to love me, and to caress and obey from that feeling.
I believe he would have died for me. When I hunted him
he jumped the biggest places at a word from my lips.
Without whip, curb, or spur I rode him for many a day,
over the difficult Ward country, and he never once played
me a shabby trick. Poor fellow! He had not a particle
of beauty about him; indeed, I think he was ridiculously
ugly, in all save prejudiced eyes; but he had an honest
heart, one that would have broken rather than have grieved
or disobeyed his owner; and when I had to shoot him (he
broke his back, leaping a drain with a friend to whom I
had unfortunately lent him for a day’s schooling), he turned
such an eye upon me as I cannot to this day think of
without a lump in my throat that is very seldom there.</p>
<a id="Page_118" href="#Page_118" class="pagenum" title="118"> </a>

<p>The voice, as an instigator and soother, is alike powerful
with the horse, if we only know how to use it; and being
so, it is a pity that it should ever be employed for any other
purpose than that which is good. Teach your horse from
the beginning to know the sound of your voice—the various
tones which signify approval, warning, encouragement, and
reproof—and by them you can teach him to obey you,
just as you can with the reins.</p>

<p>I do not altogether approve of speaking to strange
horses when mounted upon them. Were I, for instance,
to borrow a hunter for a day’s outing, I don’t think
I should be inclined to talk much to him; I should
fear that he might not understand me, and that mischief
might consequently ensue. I have, in fact, seen
men get tremendous falls in the hunting field through
shouting at hired mounts, just when they were rising
at their fences—frightening the animals out of their wits
by so doing, and throwing them completely off their
balance.</p>

<p>With your own horses, however, it ought to be quite a
different thing. You should so accustom them to the sound
of your voice that, no matter how it may be raised, it shall
have no startling effect upon them. An intelligent animal
will soon come to know and judge of your meaning by the
tone in which you speak to him, and will learn his own
name, too, marvellously quickly, if frequently called by it,
a thing that will be a great aid to you in training him.
He will very soon also comprehend the meaning of such
terms, as “Trot,” “Canter,” “Stand,” “Walk,” and so forth,
<a id="Page_119" href="#Page_119" class="pagenum" title="119"> </a>
and will ere long obey every mandate that comes directly
and firmly from your lips.</p>

<p>“Hi, over!” is, for instance, a capital incentive for making
a horse fly his fences without hanging at them,—but you
must never trade upon an animal’s intelligence for the
purpose of fooling him, or showing off. I once knew a man
who boasted that by simply saying “go!” he could make
his mare jump fifteen feet of an ordinary field, and he
tried it twice or thrice for the benefit of unbelieving
acquaintances; but, when next he took the animal out to
hunt, and raced her at a brook, with the hitherto magic
word screamed loudly in her ear, it proved to be a very
decided case of “go,” and “go in” also, for she just planted
her toes on the brink of it, and, stopping short, sent her
over-confident rider head foremost into the water.</p>

<p>The use of the whip as a means of managing a horse is,
unfortunately, too often entirely misunderstood: to hurt,
frighten, or coerce with it being seemingly the chief object
with many riders. Allowing that all three may at times be
necessary—as in the case of vicious horses, for instance—ladies
will very rarely find it to be the case, their mounts
being, generally speaking, of a gentle and docile type.
Leaving, therefore, the abuses of the whip on one side, its
uses in the hands of a competent horsewoman are usually
reduced to the part which it may be made to fill in
helping her to guide her mount on the off side—just as a
man’s second leg assists him in doing—and, in like manner,
to press him up to his work. This can, of course, be best
accomplished by the aid of a stout hunting-crop, carried
<a id="Page_120" href="#Page_120" class="pagenum" title="120"> </a>
handle uppermost, as a rule: although there are times
when to shift the position of the whip, and press the
heaviest part against the horse’s flank, will be found very
effectual, particularly when negotiating ugly trappy fences,
or turning sharp corners at a brisk trot. For example,
when, in the latter case, the turn is to the right, the rider’s
body should be bent slightly to the off side of her mount,
and her leg be pressed lightly but firmly against his flank
on the near side. This preserves an even balance, and will
often save a fast flippant trotter from coming right down.
When the turn is to the left, the body should be inclined
a little that way, while the whip handle is judiciously
pressed against the off side, thus preventing the animal’s
quarters from swinging too suddenly round.</p>

<p>I may here take occasion to say that corners ought never
to be turned without both hands being put to the bridle,
and a support given to both sides of the horse; if to the
right, the leg the strongest—if to the left, the whip. When
the pace is very quick, and the turn is a decidedly sharp
one, the horse’s hind legs will need to be brought under
him all the quicker, for which reason the body of the rider
must sway <em>well</em> with his motion, while the necessary
support is, at the same time, given on either side.</p>

<p>I shall conclude my observations about the uses of the
whip by saying—use it as little as you can to punish, and
as much as you can to aid. Above all things, <em>never take it
up in anger</em>, nor for a moment forget that the creature on
whom the stroke is about to fall is sensitive to its lightest
touch, and is fully capable of being ruled without severity.</p>
<a id="Page_121" href="#Page_121" class="pagenum" title="121"> </a>

<p>The same remarks apply also to the spur—the abuses of
which are even more general and lamentable than are
those of the whip.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<span class="chapter-title">RIDING ON THE ROAD.</span></h2>


<p>I have hitherto been surmising that your rides have been
upon your own horse: one specially purchased for you, and
perfectly trained for a lady’s use. If such a state of things
could always be ensured, equestrianism would be a safe
and delightful pastime for the gentler sex—but, unfortunately,
it cannot be so. Ladies who are much in the saddle
are called upon often to ride a variety of horses, and
under such circumstances their position is an awkward
one, if unaccustomed to manage any save thoroughly-trained
and well-mannered animals. To have none other
for one’s own use is at all times advisable, so far as it
can be done, but occasions may arise when you will
have to prove your claim to a higher title than that
of merely a “nice” or “ladylike” rider. Say, for instance,
that you are stopping at a country house, your invitation
to which has not been extended to your horse,
or yet to your groom, and that there are riding parties
every day, which you are invited to join, your host sometimes
supplying you with a mount, and a neighbour occasionally
offering to lend you one, it is scarcely probable
that, having a different animal to carry you every time
<a id="Page_123" href="#Page_123" class="pagenum" title="123"> </a>
you go out, you can hope to escape discovering the uncomfortable
effects which pernicious training, or subsequent
injudicious handling, invariably bring about. To be prepared
for these—not to be taken aback by them—to be
ready to face every emergency, and overcome every
difficulty in the way of equitation—is the true meaning
of the word “horsewoman.” It shall be my office, then,
in this chapter to endeavour to tell you as concisely as
possible how to act (in all cases of ordinary road-riding),
when called upon to control horses with whose ways you
are not altogether familiar.</p>

<p>In the first place, when your mount is led to the door,
be ready in time to go out and inspect him. This you can
readily do while the laggards of the party are preparing
for their ride. In using the term “inspect,” I do not
mean that you are to assume a confident, boastful air, or
proceed to make an ostentatious examination, as though
nobody knew anything about horse business save yourself.
This would only make you appear ridiculous, and
be calculated to incur dislike. You should go quietly to
your horse’s head, and while affecting to be engaged in
caressing him, run a hasty eye over the following points:
that the saddle is quite clear of the play of the shoulders,
and yet not too far back; that the girths are tight enough,
and the surcingle not too loose, although decidedly easier
than the girths; that the headstall is sufficiently long, and
in every way easy-fitting—the curb-chain the correct
length—the lip-strap on—the martingale (if a standing
one) of easy length, and if a running, so arranged that the
<a id="Page_124" href="#Page_124" class="pagenum" title="124"> </a>
pull of the reins shall be in the proper place—namely, at the
top of the withers. If you find nothing to correct, you
may account yourself fortunate; if, on the contrary, you
perceive that anything is amiss or out of place, signify the
same quietly to the groom, and then go indoors, or turn
aside, while he rectifies it. There is something positively
unkind in standing staring at a servant while he attends to
matters which you have pointed out to him for correction.
Ten to one, if you do so, he will grow confused beneath
your scrutiny, and will leave his task imperfectly accomplished.
Consideration for others ought at all times to be
a part of your religion. Give no unnecessary trouble; do as
much for yourself as you possibly can; never speak harshly
to even the humblest; strive to put everybody at ease; look
away from an embarrassed person until he has recovered
his composure; and if you detect a failure or shortcoming
in a servant’s work, tell him gently about it—quietly, and
without impatience—and it will probably be rectified very
much sooner than if you scolded or stormed. For my
own part, I have no liking for grooms at all, and regard
most of them as the veriest eye servers; but I know there
are times when they are unjustly blamed. In this matter
I once got a useful lesson at an English country house.
My horse was brought to the door without a lip-strap, and
with things in general so very indifferently turned out that,
being in a hurry, I got provoked, and began to say more
than my custom usually was. The groom, whose eyes
were cast down, looked pitifully at me as he answered,
“Forgive me to-day, ma’am, please. My little child died
<a id="Page_125" href="#Page_125" class="pagenum" title="125"> </a>
this morning!” And the great tears rolled down the poor
fellow’s cheeks, and I felt grieved for having spoken impatiently
to him when his heart was so sore. It was a
lesson not to be forgotten, for there are times with ourselves
when sickness or trouble prevents us from attending
properly to our tasks; and servants are liable to similar
weaknesses.</p>

<p>It will be well, when you are seated comfortably in your
saddle and have felt your horse’s mouth a little, to inquire
of your host (should the animal belong to him) whether or
not he has any peculiarities, or “little tricks,” for which it
may be as well you should be prepared. You will be
almost certain to hear “No,” for it is a strange coincidence
that men are quite as infatuated about their equine possessions
as women are about their children, and will never
on any account be induced to believe that such a thing
as a fault can possibly exist in the nature or training of
any of their stud. At the same time, it can be no harm to
<em>ask</em>, and then, if the owner can be reluctantly brought to
acknowledge that he “wants a bit of rousing,” you may
prepare yourself for the discomforts of riding a slug, or,
if the animal is allowed to be “a trifle skittish,” you can
ask for an ounce or two of diachylon, or the same quantity
of birdlime, to stick yourself well in the saddle!</p>

<p>Joking apart, it is really an unwise thing to be too
foolhardy about riding strange horses. The most courageous
equestrian in the world ought not to fancy herself
above asking, in a pleasant off-hand way, for some information
concerning the character of her casual mount;
<a id="Page_126" href="#Page_126" class="pagenum" title="126"> </a>
in fact, the more accomplished the rider, the more necessary
it may be to do so, for there are many owners of horses
who know very little themselves about riding, or of the
perils attendant upon supplying ladies with unsuitable
mounts—and the consequence is, that if there happens to
be in the stable a creature whom that Irish groom, already
mentioned, would call a “tattherin’ divil,” he is quietly told
off on a hunting day, or otherwise, for the use of the lady
or gentleman who may be esteemed the most capable of
managing him.</p>

<p>A Hungerton farmer—one of a big class—once volunteered
to lend me a magnificent high-flyer to negotiate
the big thorn fences with the Quorn pack. I was foolish
enough to accept, without asking anything about the
animal, except whether he could jump; and when I tell
you that between Beeby and Scraptoft he gave me two
falls, that he knocked down a boy on a pony, and damaged
a wrecker to the extent of a couple of sovereigns, besides
bringing me home without a hat, and with my face
well stuck over with thorns and a general need of surgical
assistance all about me, it will be readily imagined that
the “high-flyer” was not exactly an eligible beast for a
lady to ride. But his owner only stood in the doorway
laughing from ear to ear when he saw me, and uttered
a great “guffaw” on hearing the recital of his property’s
misdeeds. “Glory be to Christmas! I thought you could
ride anything!” was all that he said, fairly doubled in
two with merriment at the sight of my forlorn appearance,—and
I answered crossly enough, that had I been as wise
<a id="Page_127" href="#Page_127" class="pagenum" title="127"> </a>
when setting out as I was on returning, I would have seen
that the animal was differently bitted, and have clothed
myself in sackcloth—to say nothing of ashes—instead of
in the best hunting-gear of which I was possessed. “Well,
you never asked me a word about him,” his owner said,
still in a roar, “or I’d have told you that he was a rum
one when once he got going!” and as I had nothing to
say in reply to this, I took myself and my rags upstairs
out of sight, and spent the next day in bed, with a leech
to my eye, and plasters all over my body.</p>

<p>To return to the subject of road-riding.</p>

<p>Always strive to make your horse start from the door at a
walk. If he is properly trained he will step nicely out,
nodding his head as he goes; but no matter how quiet he
may appear, it will not be well to leave him an entirely
loose rein. You should keep a light but firm hold upon
the bridle, so as to be ready at a second’s warning to bring
restraining pressure to bear upon his mouth.</p>

<p>If you want a horse to walk fast, ride him with the
snaffle only; but when in the park, or desirous of showing
off, you will best bring out his action by a light use of the curb.
If he is a very highly-mettled animal, and anxious to get
off on first setting out, do not irritate him by keeping him
back with too tight a rein. Allow him to trot away pretty
freely at the beginning, and after awhile he will be almost
certain to settle down and walk collectedly for you with a
slack bridle. To hold a horse in, and then whip or spur
him to make him walk, is but to turn his courage to vice.
My counsel is, leave him his head, and when he attempts
<a id="Page_128" href="#Page_128" class="pagenum" title="128"> </a>
to break—namely, to get into a trot or canter—at a time
when it is your wish that he should walk, pull him gently
up and make him begin again. By adopting this method,
and preserving as strict a command over your own temper
as over the reins, you will soon teach almost any horse to
walk correctly.</p>

<p>I believe that in no other pace can there be found such
true experience of the meaning of “light hands.” This
admirable attribute—which, it must be confessed, is generally
confined to women—signifies absolute control over
an animal with scarcely any display of force—a sort of
elastic touch, by which accomplished riders convey their
meaning to their mounts through the almost imperceptible
action of the bit, acted upon by the reins held lightly with
the fingers. This is a poor explanation, but it will do to
serve as a guide, until experience shall have taught you
far better than printed instructions ever can.</p>

<p>I would have you remember that although a very perfect
walker may be permitted to go forward for a good space
with a loose rein, he should never, <em>if tired</em>, be allowed to do
so, for even one moment. Hold him with a firm, even hand,
keeping a judicious watch upon the bridle, and drawing
his head rather <em>downward</em> and <em>toward his chest</em>. By this
means he will be constrained to bring his hind legs well
and regularly under him.</p>

<p>Young riders are often exceedingly incautious when
taking beaten horses home after a hunt, desiring to affect
the seemingly careless seat and equally unstudied handling
of the reins which are the prerogatives of finished horsewomen.
<a id="Page_129" href="#Page_129" class="pagenum" title="129"> </a>
These, having complete confidence in themselves,
can afford a certain show of <em>nonchalance</em>, but it will not do
for students to follow their “carelessness,” until their own
claim to both “hands” and “seat” shall have become
perfectly ensured.</p>

<p>You must, when walking, keep your horse collected:
by which I mean that he is to be kept well on his haunches,
and prevented from crossing his legs. Let him pick his
own steps if going over rutty or uneven ground; move
with him as he moves, turn as he turns, so as to be, as it
were, a portion of him, and, when going round a corner,
do not pull his head any further in that direction than
will just enable you to see his eye.</p>

<p>Having thus considered the subject of instructing an imperfectly-broken
horse to walk well upon the road—in such
a manner as shall gain for him the reputation of being a
good roadster, or covert hack—we will now say a few words
about trotting. When you want an animal to change from a
walk to a trot, signify your wish to him by a light movement
of the bridle in his mouth, a pressure of your leg and
whip-handle, and an indication of your meaning by a
slight rising in the stirrup. When he begins to go, keep
him thoroughly well collected, but not on any account too
tightly reined in. Timid equestrians do themselves and
their mounts great injustice by fancying that a tight grip
of the bridle, and consequent shortening of the horse’s
head, is in any way calculated to ensure their safety. It is
exactly the contrary way. Allow somebody to rein back
your own head and neck, and then attempt to walk down
<a id="Page_130" href="#Page_130" class="pagenum" title="130"> </a>
an unknown staircase, or go in and out among obstacles
that you cannot see. Ten to one you will make a blunder,
and come down; whereas, had you been left your head, your
progress would in all probability have been perfectly easy
and safe. I hope I shall succeed in making my meaning
distinctly understood in this matter, because it really is a
most important one. I just want to illustrate the difference
between permitting an animal to go all abroad (or what
Tom Cannon calls “slummucking”)—and reining him in
so very tightly that he cannot see where he is expected to
plant his feet. On your complete knowledge of this
essential subject, one-half, if not more, of your success as a
horsewoman must inevitably depend, and in my anxiety
that you should grasp the meaning of it, I may, perhaps,
be found fault with for referring to it too often, or for
speaking of it in too homely a fashion. This is, I am
aware, an age of false refinement: one in which a writer
has to grapple with extraordinary difficulties, being stigmatised
as “coarse” when he ventures to set forth home
and useful truths, and “vulgar” when he writes humorously
or introduces a spice of fun. Now, it is not my way
to care in the least whether or not such terms are applied
to me by outsiders (my friends can judge for themselves)—but
I would a good deal rather any day be a “vulgar”
<em>practical</em> writer, doing some good in my generation, than a
“refined” useless one, and I think it necessary to make
reference to the matter in this place, because I have
a great deal yet to say on subjects connected with the one
on which I am writing, and if I am to dress up my
<a id="Page_131" href="#Page_131" class="pagenum" title="131"> </a>
sentences in flowers and satin ribbons, instead of suffering
the plain meaning of them to appear, I may go on writing
for many months to come, and yet fail to make myself
properly understood in the end.</p>

<p>You must bear in mind that the trot is the horse’s natural
pace, and that when not overpressed he will go further and
with less fatigue to himself when <em>regulated</em> to it, than at
either a canter or gallop. At the same time, he must not
on any account be urged beyond the limit of his powers,
for such a course is not only cruel, but dangerous—inasmuch
as an animal going a hard pace cannot, if he makes
a mistake, recover his balance as rapidly as if proceeding
at the even rate of eight, or from that to ten miles an hour.
I consider the latter excellent going indeed; too fast, in
fact, unless the remainder of your party happen to be as
well mounted as yourself—for nothing on earth is more
indicative of bad taste than riding perpetually in front of
those who are in company with you.</p>

<p>I am not, as a rule, at all in favour of allowing a horse to
break from a trot to a canter, or from one pace of any
kind to another, but there are times—when going long
distances, for instance—at which a humane rider will
permit her mount to do so by way of rest and change,
rather than keep him perpetually going at precisely the
same pace, in order to gain for him the name of an exceptionally
fine trotter.</p>

<p>Your rise and fall in the saddle should be light, graceful,
straight, easy, and accurately in time with the movements
of your horse’s forelegs. By attending to this rule when
<a id="Page_132" href="#Page_132" class="pagenum" title="132"> </a>
riding on the road, you will save yourself and your mount
a great deal of unnecessary fatigue.</p>

<p>If you find, when trotting, that your horse is going in an
uncomfortable, one-sided manner, giving now and again a
strange sort of cow kick, you may be confident that the
saddle is hurting him. In such a case dismount at once,
and if at all close to home, put the bridle over your arm
and lead him the rest of the journey. Should it happen,
however, when you are a long distance away, you must
only take him very quietly indeed, until you are near
enough to walk the remainder of the way yourself.</p>

<p>It is on just such emergencies that the practice, which I
have so staunchly recommended, of wearing comfortable
easy-fitting boots, comes most usefully in. I have seen
ladies remain seated upon the backs of most palpably suffering
horses, simply because they were absolutely incapable
of walking even half a mile in the boots which they had
donned for riding.</p>

<p>Never allow your horse to get into a jog-trot when in
company with a riding party, or in the park—but remember
that it is a most valuable pace at which to bring home a
tired hunter. A very light easy canter, wherever the road
is soft, or where there is sufficient grass by the side of it
to take the jar off his feet, or else what is known as the
“jog,” will be the most humane way of getting him safely
to his stable.</p>

<p>Many lady riders imagine that cantering is a safer as
well as a pleasanter pace at which to travel, than trotting
(whether fast or slow) can ever be. This is really a great
<a id="Page_133" href="#Page_133" class="pagenum" title="133"> </a>
mistake; trotting is the safest pace at which a horse can go,
provided that he is sound-footed. I shall strive to explain
the reason in a few words. When cantering, the off fore
and off hind leg are advanced together, leaving the others
in the rear; thus the diagonal legs of the two pairs are not set
down simultaneously. If you listen to a perfectly sound
horse trotting on a road, you will hear four even beats; but
in the canter it may be only two or three, according as the
animal’s weight is adjusted. When trotting he makes his
diagonal legs serve him turn about, so that when one pair
is going forward, the other is sustaining his weight in an
equal, or perfectly <em>even</em> manner; not in a one-sided way, as is
the case in the canter. A sound-footed horse, trotting at a
regular pace, always has two diagonal supports under him,
and two coming to their assistance, for which very reason
fast trotting is a dangerous pace when a leg or foot happens
to be unsound, or when a slovenly motion is indulged in.</p>

<p>A horse trotting quickly should never be pulled up in a
hurry. You should bring him to a slow trot by shortening
the reins, and then to a walk by sitting down in the saddle,
and talking to him in a language that he will very readily
learn to comprehend.</p>

<p>In reining a horse back, you must keep in mind the fact
that he cannot move at all if you drag him so <em>suddenly</em>
backward that he gets both hind-legs under him together.
It is a revolting and heartrending sight to see the way in
which draymen beat unfortunate horses about the breasts
and bellies by way of punishment for not backing heavy
loads far enough, when, in reality, the wretched animals
<a id="Page_134" href="#Page_134" class="pagenum" title="134"> </a>
are in such position that they cannot by any possibility
move their extended hind-legs. I saw a cruel instance of
this in Liverpool a few months ago: a carter savagely
beating his horse, a crowd of persons looking on, and one
or two among them abusing the man in no measured terms;
yet not one had the sense to tell him that if he would
only lead the horse quietly <em>forward</em>, even a step or two,
and <em>then</em> back him, doing the same thing every time that
he came to a stop, the desired object would very soon be
attained—which it was, as soon as the proper method had
been tried. This is just the principle of reining back. The
horse must be collected, and brought <em>square</em> on his legs
every time that he resists, and be again brought under the
influence of the bridle, for backing purposes, when he has
come to an even stand.</p>

<p>I fancy it will be almost superfluous to tell you to
observe strictly the rules of the road—namely, to keep to the
left, except when you have to pass anything going your
way, in which case you must get by on the right of it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />

<span class="chapter-title">PACES, VICES, AND FAULTS.</span></h2>


<p>Cantering is a very nice pace for park or road riding,
when the ground is soft, and not cut up by stones. A
trained horse will start from a walk to a canter at a very
slight indication from his rider, but surmising (as in the last
chapter) that you have accepted the loan of a somewhat
unmannerly or not sufficiently educated mount, you must
induce him to canter by collecting him well on his haunches
(from which the motion is in reality performed), touching
him with the whip on the off side, and drawing his head
gently round to the near until he makes a start. When he
does so, balance yourself in time to his movement, and use
the bridle lightly, with a very slight give-and-take motion
of your hands. Do not allow him to get into a gallop; but,
at the same time, remember that it will be cruel to keep
him cantering too long, especially unless you permit him to
change his leg, for which purpose you must pull him quietly
up, and reverse the movement by which, in the first instance,
you have urged him to go off. A slow, handsome canter,
collected and dignified, looks extremely well no doubt in
the park, but it is terribly trying to a horse when kept up
<a id="Page_136" href="#Page_136" class="pagenum" title="136"> </a>
too long; in fact, a smart, stirring gallop will not distress
him nearly so much.</p>

<p>When cantering keep your knees firmly pressed against
the pommels—sit close to the saddle, like a part of your
horse—and throw your shoulders well back.</p>

<p>The very nice pace called a hand-gallop may be indulged
in by slackening the rein a little, and encouraging
your mount by voice or bridle to go a trifle faster. The
hand-gallop never distresses a horse, even a broken-winded
one; it is a joyous, exhilarating motion, in which both
steed and rider find pleasure. Conversation need not be
stopped by it, or even interrupted for a moment, and it will
be found a delightful pace at which to go to covert in the
morning, or to travel on to the next one, when “blank” has
been called at the first.</p>

<p>The hand-gallop is only pastime—mere play, without any
peril—but the gallop proper, to which I now come to allude,
is a very serious business indeed for a young rider to take
in hand. If your horse is a trained one, you have only to
sit down close when he gallops, and hold the reins firmly in
both hands: your seat secure, your body as motionless as
you can make it, your elbows like hinges, your hands low
on the withers, keeping your horse’s head straight and
steady, while you give-and-take with his every stride, and
on no account, or under any circumstances whatever, keep
a dead pull on his mouth.</p>

<p>I shall surmise, however, as before (for the purpose of
instructing you) that your steed is not by any means perfect,
and that he will probably give you a good deal of
<a id="Page_137" href="#Page_137" class="pagenum" title="137"> </a>
trouble before you have quite done with him. He will
not be likely to have all the vices, or even one-half of those
for which I am about to prepare you, but you will probably
meet with them in one form or another at different
periods of your career as a horsewoman: therefore a few
words about such matters will not, I think, be amiss.</p>

<p>If called upon to ride a puller, get his head up, and then
drop your hands a little to him, to see whether he will yield
to your will. If he fails to do so, catch the reins short,
draw back your foot, give him one good pull, and then
another: in short, a succession of them—but yield to
him always between whiles, and speak to him in a quiet,
soothing manner. Do not attempt to fight him, or he
may run away with you, and that is nasty for a lady. If
you think that he has the bit between his teeth, you may
saw at it from side to side until you get him to release it.</p>

<p>Boring is a very unpleasant vice, if I may call it one.
Few horses have it naturally, and I attribute it in most
cases to an undue use of the curb. I have found that the
best method of treating it is to take up the cheek-pieces of
the headstall. If a horse bores to one side (a most unsightly
habit), attach the throat-latch to the ring of the
snaffle-bridle by a small strap on the side opposite to that
on which the head is bent. This is generally effectual,
because it brings the mouthpiece to bear upon the gum.</p>

<p>A kicker is not a pleasant mount for a lady, and the
powers which some animals possess in this especial line
are simply astonishing. As a rule you will perceive, either
by the laying back of your horse’s ears, or a queer wriggle
<a id="Page_138" href="#Page_138" class="pagenum" title="138"> </a>
of his body, that he is going to do something that will
stamp him as a villain, and if these indications are accompanied
by a backward turning of a very whitened eye, look
out at once for your life! Many horses will, however, give
no warning of any kind, and they of course are the
most dangerous sort. Thoroughbreds are quite dreadful
in this particular. They will kick when going a brisk
gallop. I have twice had my hat <em>lashed</em> by the tails of high
kickers—and the most stunning fall I ever got in my life
was through being caught napping by one of these volatile
gentlemen, who pretended to be going up to his bridle in
the most collected manner possible (when exercising one
day in frosty weather, in a wood), and suddenly shot me off
like an arrow from a bow!—so high, too, that to this day I
am ready to swear I saw the tops of the bare elms, while
the force of my contact with the ground, when at length I
came down upon it, gave me concussion of the spine, from
which I suffered for several succeeding months.</p>

<p>A horse that kicks must be ridden in a severe bit, except
in cases where it is only an ebullition of spirits. Where
this is the case, ride him hard, and get it out of him; when
it amounts to an actual vice, you must keep him partially
in order by using a bit such as I seriously decry for other
forms of misdemeanor, and when he begins his unpleasant
pranks get his head <em>well</em> up, so that he can’t force it
between his knees, and bend him round until you compel
him to turn. By doing this a few times he will probably
leave off kicking.</p>

<p>To ride a kicker in the hunting-field is highly injudicious
<a id="Page_139" href="#Page_139" class="pagenum" title="139"> </a>
and unfair. Some excellent hunters, however, though not
by any means confirmed kickers, will lash out dangerously
when riders are crowded together at a gap, and this is
about the very worst time at which a horse can possibly
misconduct himself. When riding one of this sort, you must
be content to pay the penalty of his vagaries by isolating
yourself from the rest of the field—a disadvantage, of
course, for all riders naturally make for the best places at
which to get out; and if, in spite of this, you are pressed
upon by others, you must put your hand to the back of
your waist, the fingers turning outwards, and motion
slightly with them, in order that those in the rear of you
may know that they are in peril.</p>

<p>Buck-jumping is another most unpleasant vice, although
happily not a very common one in this country. I have
only come across one horse who possessed it. He belonged
to a Meath farmer, and I bought him for a song on account
of his failing. He got me off five times the first day that I
attempted to ride him, and so delighted was he with himself
when he succeeded in gaining the odd number, that he
actually kept bucking about, like a playful goat, all around
me—squealing and romping, and flourishing his horrid
heels at me—while I lay exhausted upon the ground, too
much bruised to be able to get up without help. After this
I put a gag-snaffle on him, pulled the reins sharply when
he attempted to get his head down, and then, when he
lowered it in spite of me, let the leathers slip through my
fingers on to his neck, leaned back as far as ever I could
(still, however, keeping hold of the reins), and the moment
<a id="Page_140" href="#Page_140" class="pagenum" title="140"> </a>
I was able to get a pull at him, turned him round and
round from one side to the other, until both he and I were
pretty tired of the work. All things considered, I cannot
conscientiously recommend a buck-jumper for a lady’s use.</p>

<p>Rearing is a very dangerous vice for a horsewoman to
have to contend against, owing to the side position which
she occupies in the saddle. If ever you are unlucky
enough to have to mount a rearer, do not touch him with
a curb at all; ride him on the snaffle only, and when
he attempts to rise up with you, lean well forward and
clutch his mane firmly with your hands, holding the bridle
very loosely all the while, and touching him sharply with
your heel. Do not on any account lay your whip upon
him, be it ever so lightly. I myself have found the butt
end of such an article, brought down briskly between the
ears of a rearer, a very efficient mode of bringing him to
his senses,—but please bear in mind that I do not either
advocate or recommend it: in fact, rather than do so, I
should prefer to warn you <em>against</em> it, for once, when,
flushed with my own success, I chanced to say something
in favour of the system, my temerity brought thirty-two
letters down upon me (most of them from horrified old
gentlemen who declared that their daughters were practising
on the carriage horses!), and the columns of more
than one sporting paper were inundated for a month or
two with an inane correspondence.</p>

<p>I have found a rearing bit most useful at times; but, if
taken aback when riding without one, it will be well to
follow the practice of holding on to the mane with one
<a id="Page_141" href="#Page_141" class="pagenum" title="141"> </a>
hand, say the left, while with the right the reins are pulled
in a downward direction, bringing the horse’s head round
ever so little, in order if possible to make him change his
leg. The fact is, there are vicious rearers whom nothing
will cure—cunning ones who know enough never to tumble
back upon you, and are sufficiently amenable in other ways
to encourage the hope that something may be made of
them—playful ones who transgress more from skittishness
than vice—and timid ones who, having suffered from too
severe bitting, throw themselves upward as soon as they
feel the touch of the bridle upon their mouths. An
accomplished horsewoman will soon distinguish the differences
which mark these various offenders, and will act
with coolness and judgment, according as her training may
point out to her. I believe that to be perfectly cool on all
occasions, never to be flurried, or taken unawares, and
above all things never to lose temper, no matter how trying
the circumstances, will best ensure successful equestrianism,
both for men and women. To expect to ride without
encountering difficulties and worries, as well as risks and
dangers, is only to look for something that cannot possibly
be attained. Ride, of course, you may—if to sit calmly on
a slug’s back, and walk him round a grass field, or along a
country road, can be called riding—but the term, in the
sense in which I apply it, means something very different
indeed. It is replete with dangers and anxieties of all
sorts, but surely it is worth them. Many a time, when I
have come in fagged, heated, and dirty, after battling with
a young beginner—or ragged and weary after a hard day’s
<a id="Page_142" href="#Page_142" class="pagenum" title="142"> </a>
hunting through bush and briar, it has been said to me,
“Surely the pleasure, such as it is, cannot repay you for
the toil.” Utter nonsense, of course! Is <em>any</em> trouble, or
any loss, for an instant remembered in the joyous burst of
music with which hounds rattle their fox out of covert, or
the delight of feeling a hitherto intractable youngster
bending at length submissively to one’s will?</p>

<p>Often and often now, when sitting alone in my quiet
study, or watching the active pleasures from which I am
wholly debarred, I feel how truly I have “had my day”—a
most happy one—and how willingly I would go through
the same sufferings, if consequent upon the same joys.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tempora mutantur.</i> Even so, let it pass.</p>

<p>Shying cannot properly be called a vice, though many
consider it one. I think it generally proceeds from defective
vision, and where this is the case the animal may be led
quietly up to the object of his aversion, and shown that it
is nothing very dreadful after all. Shying at a bicycle or
road-engine is so extremely natural that the rider—so far
from showing any anger against his mount—ought to
soothe and quiet him by every means in his power. A
young, fresh horse will shy at a bird, a piece of paper—anything—but
a clever equestrian should never be discomposed
by such trifles. A steady seat ought to be
sufficient security against all possible disaster.</p>

<p>Stumbling is a very unpleasant weakness, though not a
vice. Being too heavily shod is often a cause of it, and
this of course can be remedied; but there is little chance of
effecting any good when the fault proceeds from defective
<a id="Page_143" href="#Page_143" class="pagenum" title="143"> </a>
muscular action, or from malformation of the feet. Neither
can it be cured when it arises from the shoulders being too
straight, or the forelegs shaky. A bad, cramped trotter
without any proper knee action, is extremely likely to
stumble and come down, and all that a rider can possibly
do with such a one is to keep him well collected—I do not
mean reined in, but going properly up to his bridle—and
to make him bring his hind legs under him, at whatever
pace he may be going. I greatly dislike the habit, common
among ignorant riders and drivers, of <em>striking</em> a horse when
he stumbles: it cannot then effect any good, and is calculated
to give him an unpleasant habit of prancing about whenever
the mishap occurs.</p>

<p>Disquietude in mounting is a very serious fault. Some
horses plunge and dance in a highly dangerous manner—the
result of nervousness, or of having at some time or
another been frightened by some mischance. When this is
the case the horse ought to be held for a moment or two
by the snaffle rein <em>only</em>, quite close to the cheek, and be
spoken to at the same time in a soothing manner. He
should never on any account be scolded, and by-and-by,
when he quiets down a little, the groom should stand at
his head, and hold the snaffle-reins firmly but lightly in
both hands. If you perceive that he (the attendant) is not
thoroughly master of his business, it will be yours to see
that he does not by any movement bring the curb into
action, or pinch the horse’s jaw.</p>

<p>Running away is a desperate vice for a lady to have to
grapple with, and my own experiences of it warn me to put
<a id="Page_144" href="#Page_144" class="pagenum" title="144"> </a>
others on their guard. If a horse is <em>known</em> to be a runaway,
never be induced to trust yourself upon his back. He will
do it again at some time or another, even though his first
offence may have almost passed out of mind, and it will be
better that you should give him a wide berth. I must
candidly say, however, that I would rather, for my own
safety, ride ten practised runaways—what are called old
hands at it—than one mad, frightened horse that had lost
his wits from some real cause of alarm.</p>

<p>The best advice that I can give in either case is this: Do
not keep a dead pull upon the reins, because that will not
be a particle of use; in fact, by doing so you will only be
supporting his head, and giving him stamina to go faster.
Try by <em>a succession</em> of strong jerks and pulls to prevent
him getting fully into his stride, for once he does so you
may bid good-bye to any chance of stopping him until he
has run himself clean out. A horse that is not a confirmed
runaway may be checked by sawing his mouth hard with
the snaffle, but my advice is, do not try to stop him at all,
if you have fair going ground before you, or that you can
possibly breast him up any sort of incline. In such case,
let him go—sit close down in your saddle—and when you
feel him slacken, take up your whip in earnest, and give it
him within an inch of his life. This <em>latter</em> advice, however,
only applies to “rogues”—animals who habitually
run away and endanger their riders. To whip a really
startled horse would be both cruel and unwise; nor is it
ever judicious to do so in cases where the going is not both
fair and <em>open</em> in front of you. If run away with in park or
<a id="Page_145" href="#Page_145" class="pagenum" title="145"> </a>
street, you must endeavour to keep clear of trees and
vehicles, and strive to get your horse stopped as best you
can. Happily, such catastrophes do not very often occur.</p>

<p>I am against the theory that a rider ought in all instances
to stick to a runaway horse. As a <em>rule</em> it is better
to do so, but there are decidedly a few exceptions. A pet
idea of my own is to bring him down, in whatever way
it can best be done; but I do not for a moment want to
persuade others to do this. One man’s meat is another
man’s poison; and on this principle a plan which is, or has
been, successful in my own hands might prove a dangerous
failure in another’s. I once stopped a maddened horse
that had made away with me at Melton, by letting him
have his head for about a furlong, or something less, and
then giving him one stupendous tug with the reins. The
sudden jerk to his mouth caused him to cross his legs, and
he came down a “thundering cropper,” giving me one, of
course, also; but riding, as I always did, in a plain racing
stirrup, without having my foot thrust “home,” I got clear
off, and escaped without any more serious injury than a
very severe shaking. The sensation was not a nice one,
I confess, and the peril was great; but, on the whole, I
should prefer it again to enacting Mazeppa, or something
like it, on the back of a wild steed, who would probably
not stop until he had landed his rider at that fatal bourne
from whence no traveller returns.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<span class="chapter-title">A LESSON IN LEAPING.</span></h2>


<p>Surmising that you are now as perfect as possible in park
and road riding, you must qualify yourself as a huntress
by learning to jump every kind of obstacle that will be
likely to come in your way. Indeed, it is advisable for
every rider, even though destined to spend a lifetime
without ever hearing the music of the hounds, to acquire
practice in leaping, as a means of improving the seat and
securing immunity from possible danger and inconvenience.
I mean to convey, that to a lady equestrian who knows
nothing of sitting over a jump, a long ride in the country
will be likely to prove somewhat embarrassing, seeing that
newly-cut ditches and small sheep-hurdles are frequently
to be met with, and where some members of the party
jump them and others hang back, the difference of opinion
will not tell in favour of the laggards. To be ready for <em>all</em>
emergencies is the rule of good riding, and even if country
difficulties have not to be encountered, there may be times—probably
will be—when an animal will bounce suddenly
forwards, or bound into the air from very exuberance of
spirits, and if his rider has not learned to sit over a fence
it will be ten to one against her keeping her position in the
<a id="Page_147" href="#Page_147" class="pagenum" title="147"> </a>
saddle. An unprepared or untaught rider is always thrown
forward by a horse’s leap, and the object to be gained by
teaching is to be able to offer suitable resistance to this—and
to do so, no matter how sudden or unexpected the
movement may be.</p>

<p>Some excellent authorities assert that a lady’s first
leaping lessons ought always to be in a school. I object
to the word “always” in this instance, and should like to
substitute “generally.” Without in the very least depreciating
the excellence of school teaching—for it sometimes
<em>is</em> excellent, though oftener the reverse—I have nevertheless
undertaken to teach “riding without a master,” and with
this object in view I shall offer a few hints upon the subject
in a simple, common-sense fashion, which I hope may prove
profitable to those who wish to learn.</p>

<p>I think it an excellent plan, if in the country, to begin
by practising over fallen trees—or if a place can be found
where two or three of these have been felled together and
are lying at short distances from one another, so much
the better. Such a spot affords capital schooling-ground.
Small ditches too, and cuttings, are very nice—and so are
little streams that don’t call for much exertion on the part
of the rider to enable her to get over them. If, however,
your surroundings are not such as will admit of your
practising over natural obstacles of an easy nature, have
one or two artificial ones erected, in the shape of small
hurdles, interwoven with gorse or some such matter, but
strive to avoid taking your first leaps over a bar—a thing at
which many horses are apt to go “slovenly,” owing to the
<a id="Page_148" href="#Page_148" class="pagenum" title="148"> </a>
fact that they see the daylight underneath, and have sense
to know quite well that they are only being humbugged.</p>

<p>When you have acquired a certain amount of confidence
over such trifling obstacles as I have mentioned, it will be
well for you to enlist the services of a good rider, and ask
him to pilot you over a few easy fences, and to show you
the way through a gap or two, with perhaps a small ditch
on the off or landing side. You must avoid being too
ambitious, or over-confident, if you happen, fortunately, to
get on well at first. The horse on which you practice
should be a steady, easy jumper, neither too flippant nor
at all apt to refuse, and you should ride him without a
spur, until such time as you are qualified to take him into
the hunting-field.</p>

<p>When going straight at a leap, sit firmly in the centre of
your saddle, your head well up, your eyes looking right
between your horse’s ears, the snaffle reins in both hands,
with just a slight feeling upon your mount’s mouth, without
<em>any</em> attempt at holding him back or clinging by the bridle
to secure your own safety. Never on any account contract
the habit of clutching short at the reins, or at any part of
the saddle, in order to help you in preserving your balance—nor
should you throw up your hands, which must in all
instances be kept low and steady. When approaching a
leap, bend your body slightly backwards from the waist
up, at the same time keeping your seat firmly in the
middle of the saddle, that you may not be disconcerted by
the action of the loin-muscles of the horse. The degree to
which this “leaning back” is to be carried must of course
<a id="Page_149" href="#Page_149" class="pagenum" title="149"> </a>
depend altogether upon the size and nature of the leap to
be accomplished; for example, at a big-drop, or down-jump,
a good rider will almost touch the horse’s croup, but you
must never lose sight of the fact that it is the <em>shoulders</em>
that are to be bent flexibly backwards (returning to an
upright position on landing), and not any part of the body
that lies below the waist.</p>

<p>The two great secrets of leaping are, to sit like a centaur
while your waist and shoulders adapt themselves pliantly
to the movements of your horse—and never to interfere
with his mouth. Plenty of headroom has always been my
cry; I believe that where it is attended to there is very
rarely an accident. Horses, even those that are not very
highly trained, are marvellously clever, and will generally
put their feet in the right places if allowed to see where
they <em>are</em> to put them, but a rider might just as well blindfold
a horse at once—tie a thick bandage across his eyes—and
then expect him to fence safely, as draw the reins so
tight when he is rising that even if not absolutely thrown
down by the action, he is prevented from seeing where
he is expected to land. A horse cannot possibly do his
work well or generously when compelled to carry his rider
with his mouth—nor can a rider derive the pleasure that he
is seeking while sitting altogether wrongly in the saddle.</p>

<p>It is quite beautiful to see the way in which young horses
fence when their mouths are not interfered with. I have
often taken a raw youngster out over a trappy country, with
only leading reins on him, or long ropes, and have jumped
alongside of him over the little ditches, transported with
<a id="Page_150" href="#Page_150" class="pagenum" title="150"> </a>
delight at the manner in which he gathered his haunches
under him, and the clever way in which, on landing, he
planted his feet. It is really charming to watch them, and
most sad to think and know that by-and-by, when some
professedly fine, but in reality totally ignorant rider gets
upon their backs, every second fence or so will witness a
cropper, and the young, fleet-limbed, spirited creatures will
be beaten, and pulled at, and called “brutes,” and sworn
at too, as though it were not the clumsy hands at their
mouths that were in reality bringing them to grief.</p>

<p>Good hunters are, times out of number, thrown down by
their riders. A lady, for instance, borrows a mount for a day,
and hears from his owner (who perhaps knows very little
indeed about horsemanship) that he’s a “capital goer, but
wants a little <em>lifting</em> at his fences.” I have heard that idiotic
expression made use of hundreds, nay, thousands of times.
Well, out she goes; the animal, fresh and buoyant, starts
away at a nailing pace, and when not interfered with goes
skying over obstacles from which others are turning away,—but
the half-frightened rider on his back has that word
“lifting” imprinted upon her sensitive brain, and the moment
the horse takes off at the first big fence, up go her hands
with a sudden haul at the bridle, and the animal, surprised
and thrown off his balance by the action, lands unevenly,
if he lands at all, and very likely gives her a severe fall.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus-150-f.jpg" width="600" height="374" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>“HI, OVER! MY BEAUTY.”</p>
  <p class="right"><i><a href="#Page_150">page 150</a>.</i></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>There is not one on earth who is more against permitting
any “slummucking,” or romping, or going “abroad,” than
I am myself; to keep a horse well collected has always
been my teaching; leave him his head when coming up to
<a id="Page_151" href="#Page_151" class="pagenum" title="151"> </a>
a fence; let him stretch his neck to see what it is; keep a
light, <em>very</em> light, feeling upon the snaffle when he makes
his effort; and, as he lands, but <em>not</em> till then, give him a
gentle support with <em>both</em> hands—especially if the jump is
a very big one, in order that he may not “peck.” Bear in
mind, however, that if you attempt this support too soon—when
he is in the air, for instance, or in fact until he needs
it—you will undoubtedly throw him down. Practice will
teach you all these things far better than anything else, but a
careful study of them should not on any account be despised.</p>

<p>Horses do not as a rule like schooling. I believe they
abhor it; there is not any kind of excitement about it—no
emulation, no company, nothing, in short, to keep up
the “go,”—therefore I maintain that more falls are to be
had when practising in this way (owing to the fact that
animals will not jump so generously as when actually going
the pace), than are ever to be met with in the hunting-field.
Still, it must occasionally be done, especially where young
hunters are to be kept in practice—and I strongly advise
you to undertake the doing of it yourself, rather than
entrust your favourites to a heavy-handed groom, who will
rattle the lives half out of them, and cram them at their
fences in a manner calculated to spoil them utterly for your
own subsequent use.</p>

<p>Never believe anybody who tells you that the best equestrians
sit forward when their horses jump, and backward
when they land. Such is really not the case at all. In
some instances they may have begun by doing so—taught
probably by a military riding-master to think it the proper
<a id="Page_152" href="#Page_152" class="pagenum" title="152"> </a>
thing—but one or two sounding knocks upon the nose or in
the middle of the forehead, received through inability to
regulate the precise time for the two distinct movements,
have taught them to discard the theory as nonsensical,
which it most certainly is.</p>

<p>I believe a great deal in having <em>confidence</em>, and in the
power of imparting the same feeling to your horse; also, in
keeping both him and yourself in perfect good temper.
Ride him with judgment, and he will soon learn to understand
exactly what it is that you want of him. Never take
him too fast at wide ditches, or at fences that necessitate a
<em>rise</em>; in all such instances suffer him to measure his stride;—give
him time—don’t hustle him—(an unwise and horrid
habit), let him gather his hind legs well under him, and on
no account hold him hard on the curb. Remember, likewise,
that you must <em>always</em> leave him sufficient length of rein to
enable him to extend his neck.</p>

<p>I am against going over fast, even at water, unless the
place is a formidably wide one. I think that undue haste
<em>must</em> prevent a horse from measuring his stride, and that this
is the reason why animals so frequently take-off too soon,
and consequently either over-jump themselves, or land short.
They have done it with myself, many times, in the early
days of my riding career; there is scarcely a branch of the
Lara in which I have not been ducked, and surely <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">experientia
docet</i>. Moreover, a horse cannot possibly last in
anything like a fast run, unless he is kept collected. A
sprawler very soon comes to the end of his tether, while
fair-and-easy goes far in the day. This is particularly the
<a id="Page_153" href="#Page_153" class="pagenum" title="153"> </a>
case where ridge and furrow, or marshy ground, have to be
traversed.</p>

<p>You should accustom your horse to do small places
slowly; blind fences and ugly <em>trappy</em> obstacles must be
negotiated with deliberation, for the very worst falls are got
through hustling animals at such things as these.</p>

<p>You should never take your horse’s attention for a moment
from his work. A bad rider comes “fighting up” to a
fence: spurring, striking, and jagging at his horse’s mouth—and
somehow the good riders are not sorry when the
fretted animal jerks his tormentor off, and gallops away
without him. A mind at ease and undisturbed is absolutely
essential to a fencer; to strike or spur him at a critical
moment will probably throw him out of his stride, and may
be the means also of throwing the rider out of the saddle.</p>

<p>There are certain varieties of jumps which it will be well
to consider in detail, especially as beginners are apt to think
that if they succeed with tolerable credit in getting over a
few small cuttings in the country, they are fully qualified to
take foremost place in the ranks of fair Dianas.</p>

<p>In timber-jumping, to begin with, you must remember
that a horse quite fresh from his stable will naturally be
able to accomplish much more than when half pumped out;
and as a fall over timber is much nastier for a lady than
almost any other description of casualty, I strongly advise
you not to urge an animal that has jumped, say, four feet of
timber with you at the first go off, to do more than three, or
three and a-half, at the second. The reason is simply this:
to accomplish timber safely a horse <em>must</em> rise <em>well</em> at it; this
<a id="Page_154" href="#Page_154" class="pagenum" title="154"> </a>
he cannot do if at all pumped out, and the consequence is
that he hits it with his knees, or chest, and gives himself
and his rider a terrific fall. There are fences that may be
taken at a swing, others that can be scrambled over, and
others again that must be negotiated deliberately, requiring
more coolness than courage to accomplish the doing of them
safely—but timber <em>must</em> be got over in thoroughly hunter-like
fashion, or a terrific crash will be the result. High
stiff rails, or gates, have more perils for riders than any other
obstacle that can be met with in the hunting-field, not even
excepting walls; for many hunters will go collectedly and
steadily at these latter, when a four or five-barred gate, with
the daylight showing through and letting them see what is
on the other side will be either refused, or done in decidedly
slovenly fashion, in which case the latter state is infinitely
worse than the first.</p>

<p>In taking an up-jump, throw your head and shoulders
well back, so that you may escape being struck in the face,
and leave your horse unlimited headroom, for the danger of
a leap of this description is, that the animal may not get his
quarters sufficiently under him to land safely on his legs,
and may in consequence be in danger of going back: in
such case, if he is in the slightest degree trammelled about
the mouth, he will be unable to stretch his neck or make
the necessary struggle to recover himself.</p>

<p>Many ladies have a horror of going over water, the dread
of immersion being no doubt the paramount cause of it;
but I have always thought that a good wide brook, or
a narrow branch of a river, was about the safest of all
<a id="Page_155" href="#Page_155" class="pagenum" title="155"> </a>
obstacles to encounter. In saying this, I of course mean
where the banks are sound, for if either the taking-off or
landing-ground happens to be marshy or rotten, there is<!--TN: was 'in'-->
nothing more conducive to a ducking.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus-155-f.jpg" width="600" height="404" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>BROOK JUMPING.</p>
  <p class="right"><i><a href="#Page_155">page 155</a>.</i></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Horses do not, as a rule, enjoy jumping water; some
blood ones don’t object to it, but most animals hate it, and
will refuse if they can, especially where they have at any
time had what is called “a cold bath.” Should you ever
happen to be riding a horse who, on seeing water, gradually
shortens his stride, and “shuts up” as he approaches it, do
not try to get him over, for you may be certain that he
will not have it. All very fine, it may be, to talk about
not allowing yourself to be conquered, but the strongest
effort in the world won’t make a horse jump water safely
when he once refuses it, and it will not be pleasant to
stand cudgelling him upon the bank, while he plants his
toes in the sedges every time that you bring him back to
it, with an air as though he were saying, “You may
keep me here till doomsday, but over it I <em>won’t</em> go, unless
you hire a skiff to carry me.”</p>

<p>A good water-jumper, going skimming along, ought to
clear eighteen or twenty feet: even five-and-twenty not
being over-much accounted of (with Irish horses, at all
events) where the banks are sound; yet, as a rule, a
brimming brook of fourteen feet will generally stop at
least half a large field. There are two reasons for this:
firstly, if the water is visible from a distance, horses
slacken, and riders funk; and secondly, if it runs between
banks, they gallop up to look at it, and then, all is lost.</p>
<a id="Page_156" href="#Page_156" class="pagenum" title="156"> </a>

<p>The better bred a horse is, the better water-jumper he
will assuredly be. Coarse-bred horses who are clever
enough at ordinary fences, will almost always go clumsily
at water, if they can be got to go at it at all; the reason
being that clean-bred horses are the only really good
<em>stayers</em>, and as deep or wide water is seldom met with at
the beginning of a run, they alone have the stamina to
carry them safely over, after galloping perhaps a stiff line
of country for thirty minutes or so, with scarcely any
check. When jumping water, give your horse a very long
rein, and don’t touch him with the curb. Steady him
when coming up to it, and again on landing, in order that
he may get safely away on the other side, and not either
peck or sprawl.</p>

<p>If you have to jump a thorn fence, and that it is leaning
<em>towards</em> you, be sure there is something ugly on the
other side, and go at it with sufficient determination to give
your horse the necessary impetus for a safe get-over. If, on
the other hand, the ditch is on the taking-off side, and that
the hedge leans away from you, take him very steadily and
deliberately—letting him see exactly what he has to do.</p>

<p>Finally, if the horse that you are riding happens to be
old, or what is called “dickey,” namely, shaky on the forelegs,
be careful about jumping him when the ground is
hard. This applies likewise to tender-footed animals. I
have ridden horses in February who travelled delightfully
over soft slushy ground, and fenced splendidly when up to
their fetlocks in mud,—yet, when March came round, and
lands were dry and hard, they stood still and shivered at
<a id="Page_157" href="#Page_157" class="pagenum" title="157"> </a>
the sight of even an ordinary sheep-hurdle or small scoured
drain. To force a horse to jump, under such circumstances
is inhuman and unwise.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<span class="chapter-title">MANAGING REFUSERS.</span></h2>


<p>Riding refusers is unprofitable work for ladies, yet
nothing seems to be more general in every hunting-field.
I firmly believe that men ground their well-known objections
to ladies hunting chiefly on this very thing,—nor is
it altogether to be wondered at. What, for instance, can
be more annoying to a well-mounted straight-going hunter
than to have a lady get in front of him at a fence—the
only negotiable spot in it, perhaps—and keep him and a
number of others back, though hounds are running in
the next field, while she whips, and kicks, and jags the
mouth of a horse that is determined not to have it? Of
course the rule in all such cases is that the rider of the
refuser shall at once pull off and suffer the rest of the field
to go by; but ladies never seem to remember that it applies
to them, or ought at least to do so, quite as much as to
their brethren or pilots, and so they resolutely hold the
place, dragging first with one rein and then the other, and
shouting “<em>Go</em> on” with great apparent bravery, while the
horse dances and sidles, and shows every tooth in his head,
owing to the continued drag upon his mouth, and disgusted
horsemen turn away with very naughty expressions
<a id="Page_159" href="#Page_159" class="pagenum" title="159"> </a>
scarce checked upon their lips, and gallop off to seek some
other means of getting over.</p>

<p>I have seen this sort of thing scores of times, and have
felt angry and sorry about it together—angry at witnessing
the punishment to the horse, as well as at being kept back
myself when I wanted to get forward, and sorry for the
ignorance, and occasionally the <em>temper</em>, which was the
cause of it all.</p>

<p>Most riders—ladies especially—seem to have a firmly-rooted
conviction that horses only refuse from vice, and
consequently they form an idea that to whip it out of them
will be the very best method of procedure that they can
possibly adopt. A more ignorant theory could not by any
possibility be acted upon. Unskilled riders, or those who
are unpossessed of sufficient bodily strength to pull their
horses well together when coming up to a fence (so as to
make the animals shorten their stride and collect themselves
before reaching it), will frequently meet with refusals;
whereas, an accomplished horsewoman, even though labouring
under the disadvantage of being mounted upon
a vastly inferior animal, will be carried safely over, without
any attempt to baulk. The truth is, a horse that is ridden
either wildly or carelessly at his fences will be almost
certain to refuse them, because he feels instinctively that
he cannot take the jump with safety, or knows perhaps that,
owing to the non-regulation of his speed, he will be
<em>compelled</em> to take-off too soon, or not soon enough. This
is one reason for refusing. Horses do not like endangering
themselves; they are often more methodical, more cool-headed—shall
<a id="Page_160" href="#Page_160" class="pagenum" title="160"> </a>
I say more sensible?—than their riders; and
where an animal feels that he cannot jump a place with
safety to himself, he will generally decline having anything
to do with it at all. There are, of course, some big, bold,
fearless hearts—just as there are among riders—that will
go for everything, houses included, should such happen to
come in their way, and give no thought at all to consequences;
but they are not always the best sort for ladies
to<!--TN: was 'fo'--> ride. Something cool and collected will be found much
better.</p>

<p>Allowing, then, that timidity—or, more properly speaking
lack of <em>confidence</em>—is the primary cause of refusals, we
have to consider it in juxtaposition with another, which will
be far more difficult to deal with—namely, obstinacy, or
sulk.</p>

<p>I know quite well that when readers arrive at this point
they will at once want to be told how they are to distinguish
between the two. I did, when I found that from
time to time I had to contend against both evils. Well, I
am about to tell you all that I know of it.</p>

<p>When you are coming up to something which you know
quite well your horse can easily accomplish, and you nevertheless
feel him give a sort of wriggle under you, while at
the same time he begins to stiffen himself and drop out
of his stride, you may know that he means roguery,
and consequently be prepared for his sticking his toes
in the ground when he gets up to it, and assuming a
stony aspect, as though he were indifferent to consequences,
and would be quite willing to stop there for a
<a id="Page_161" href="#Page_161" class="pagenum" title="161"> </a>
week, or even a fortnight, without grumbling, provided that
you were obliging enough to carry him his water and corn
with tolerable regularity. If, on the contrary, he gallops
boldly up to the obstacle, throws his head forward, pulls it
suddenly back, shivers slightly, and at once commences a
<i>retrograde</i> movement, while signs of sweating break out
upon his skin, you may be certain that he is refusing from
timidity and not from vice. He lacks confidence in his
powers, for some reason or another, unknown perhaps to
you, but of which he himself is perfectly cognisant. He
may have weak hocks, and be afraid to venture upon
propelling himself, for fear of falling short. The hind
quarters—hind legs, in fact—are the real <i>propellers</i>, the
front ones being chiefly serviceable as supports: and if a
horse feels that he cannot depend upon himself behind, he
will naturally hesitate about rising to a leap. Watch, for
example, a dog when recovering from a fit of sickness. He
may, perhaps, be very anxious to get upon some particular
chair, couch, or window cushion, which in the days of his
robust health was a perfectly easy jump for him—yet now
he is so weak on his hind legs that, although a strong
desire to take the leap is palpably present with him, timidity
nevertheless keeps him standing looking at it, and moving
uneasily about in front of it; crouching at one instant as
though prepared to make his spring, and the next rising
upwards with a sort of whine, as though he gave it hopelessly
up. It is just because he is timid about propelling
himself. The goal cannot be reached by a mere extension
of the body, or by any action of the forelegs, and the
<a id="Page_162" href="#Page_162" class="pagenum" title="162"> </a>
hinder ones are, owing to their weakness, absolutely unable
to accomplish their natural work.</p>

<p>It is precisely so with the horse. Where hocks or hind-quarters
are in a condition that deprives him of proper
propelling power, he will certainly hesitate about exercising
or bringing them into muscular play; nor can we rightfully
offer him either chastisement or blame.</p>

<p>Again, an animal’s hesitation about taking a jump may
arise from a terror of experiencing painful concussion on
landing. Corns will cause this, so will splints, or injured
or tender ligaments of any description. It is often the
case that when a horse baulks at a fence his rider is able
to remember that he jumped the preceding one only half
generously, and landed perhaps very gingerly after his
effort. Where this is the case the animal should never be
pressed. To compel him to take a leap for which he shows
unwillingness may entail a bad fall for both him and his
rider: the former being, under all circumstances, a good
deal the more to be pitied.</p>

<p>When a horse refuses from timidity, and you yet have
reason to know that there is nothing whatever wrong with
him, take him back a bit from the fence, and send him at
it again, sitting well down in your saddle, and catching a
determined hold of his head, with the hands held low and
the reins well apart. Speak encouragingly to him at the
same time, and press him up with your leg on the near side,
and the handle of your hunting-crop on the other; but do
not on any account cut or spur him, unless you know him
to be a rogue—in which case give him plenty of it, in a
<a id="Page_163" href="#Page_163" class="pagenum" title="163"> </a>
wise and temperate way; but never enter into a determined
warfare with him unless you are absolutely certain that
you can come off the victor.</p>

<p>My experience is that once a horse <em>resolutely</em> baulks, with a
fixed determination to continue to do so, no man on earth—and
certainly no woman—can by any possibility conquer
him while on his back. Under such circumstances it will
be better to strive to accomplish the desired purpose in
some other way; either get off, if you are in a suitable
place for it, and that your reins and whip are long enough,
and by so doing <em>make</em> him have it, or—which will be better—take
him to another part of the same fence, and don’t
<em>begin</em> by fighting him, but rather leave it to his honour to
carry you generously over, and ten to one he will. I
greatly disapprove of punishing a horse severely at one
spot; it is highly calculated to give him a thorough hatred
of jumping, and to spoil his temper also in a way that may
not easily be remedied. Moreover, it is cowardly in the
extreme, for the battle is almost entirely one-sided. Were
the dumb combatant able to whip and spur and swear in
return, the rider would have a very small chance of abusing
him for any length of time together; but it is because the
creature is ignorant of his own strength and power that he
submits himself a slave to man’s too cruel rule.</p>

<p>Now, another hint or two before proceeding to a different
subject.</p>

<p>Horses will sometimes refuse through feeling themselves
“out of hand,” or being ridden timorously by inexperienced
riders. Where this is likely to be the case, such a bridle
<a id="Page_164" href="#Page_164" class="pagenum" title="164"> </a>
as a Pelham, for instance, ought not to be employed, but
rather a good powerful <em>double</em> bridle, the curb of which may
be used when galloping, and the pressure of it released for
that of the snaffle when just coming up to a fence.</p>

<p>I have seen horses, many times, refuse through their
riders having the horrid practice of throwing up the right
arm just at the critical moment of rising: by way, I
suppose, of affecting a hard-riding air, or perhaps of obtaining
some imaginary balance of the body. The habit is a
most hateful one, and frequently causes a horse to “rush,” in
cases where he is too bold to baulk or absolutely to refuse.
It is also extremely apt to make him swerve, owing to the
fact that the pressure is retained on one side of his mouth
only, in place of being preserved evenly upon both.</p>

<p>I may say in conclusion that that capital sportsman,
Captain Horace Hayes, once told me of somebody, who, by
a very clever expedient, cured a horse of refusing water-jumping.
The animal, it appears, used always to baulk at
water, and then, when pressed, jump right into the middle
of it with a terrific splash. One day a happy thought struck
his owner, and he at once proceeded to put it in practice.
An artificial water-jump was by his direction constructed
upon his own lands, and at the bottom of it, quite sunk
from view by weighting, he placed a quantity of thorny
bushes. When the affair was satisfactorily completed, he
had the horse led quietly out, got upon his back, and rode
him boldly at the obstacle. The animal tried to stop as
usual, and ended (as usual also) by jumping slap into the
middle; but on this notable occasion, he scrambled out
<a id="Page_165" href="#Page_165" class="pagenum" title="165"> </a>
with astonishing celerity, and ever afterwards fairly <em>flew</em>
every water-jump that he happened to come across. The
thorns, easily picked out, did him no harm in the world,
while the lesson was productive of an immensity of good.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />

<span class="chapter-title">FALLING.</span></h2>


<p>To be able to fall well is an art in itself—but it is one at
which, unfortunately, very few ladies excel; therefore, not
to fall at all will in their case be much better than to do
so in even the most artistic fashion.</p>

<p>At the same time to dispense with falls must in a measure
mean to dispense with riding also—that is, with riding
straight to hounds; and as this latter enjoyment is, to a
keen sportswoman, the very greatest pleasure that earth can
possibly afford, I cannot wish to see any of my readers
deprived of it, and have therefore determined to devote this
chapter to the subject of various kinds of falls—the circumstances
under which they generally happen, the way to
avoid meeting them, and the best method of escaping being
injured by them when they chance to occur.</p>

<p>To escape falls will to many ladies be the most interesting
portion of my subject; therefore, we will consider it first.</p>

<p>To begin, then: you should decline riding any save the
most perfect horses. A rusher, refuser, runaway, or anything
else associated with the vices which have already been
treated of, should be at once put beyond the pale of your
favour; nothing short of positive perfection should ever
<a id="Page_167" href="#Page_167" class="pagenum" title="167"> </a>
tempt you to mount. Secondly, you must never on any
account be in a hurry, nor allow others to hustle you.
Though hounds may be in full cry within a field of you,
and only a single small fence dividing, you must take your
time, deliberately, and without flurry. Thirdly, you must
never under any circumstances make for the fastest <i>route</i>,
nor jump a big place to get on terms with the pack; on the
contrary, you must let the hard-riding fraternity go by on
all occasions, and then, warned by their mishaps, calmly
pick your own places, and get through gaps and gates as
best you can. Fourthly, you must watch the very first
signs of tiring that are visible in your horse, and on perceiving
them give in at once, and either ride or rail him
quietly home. Fifthly, you must be decidedly wealthy, to
allow of your purchasing marvels that can never by any
chance contrive to put a foot astray. Sixthly, you must
be a first-class judge of horseflesh, to enable you to find
out such unheard-of acquisitions: and seventhly, you must
possess a calmness of temperament very rarely to be met
with among horsewomen—coupled with a wisdom to which
that of Solomon, or Minerva, was a mere bagatelle.</p>

<p>I fancy, having got thus far, that I hear some lady
asking rather disconsolately <em>why</em> I thus jest about serious
matters, and whether it is really not possible, except
on the conditions I have named, for an equestrian to
ride to hounds without receiving falls,—and I at once
answer that, according to my ideas of straight riding, it
certainly is not. Whenever I hear a lady boast that she
can ride two, three, or four days a week without ever
<a id="Page_168" href="#Page_168" class="pagenum" title="168"> </a>
getting a tumble, I at once surmise that she must be a very
mild goer indeed; that she never rides hard except on
exceptional days, when a country with which she is perfectly
familiar happens to be traversed, and that the click
of her horse’s hoofs is heard far oftener upon the roads
than is the thunder of them on the broad fields, where bullfinch
and yawning chasm offer difficulties with which the
“cautious ones” do not care to meddle.</p>

<p>There is no denying the fact that if you mean to harden
your heart and go straight, not stopping to take mental
measurements of any obstacle that you may chance to
encounter, falls will assuredly be your portion, and probably
a good many of them, too; for you must remember that no
matter how perfect may be your skill in the saddle, or how
admirable the training of your steed, such things cannot
afford you complete immunity from danger, so long as the
hunting-field is flooded (which it unfortunately is) with
ignorant horsemen, mounted on all kinds of animals—rough-riders,
who care little about jostling and cannoning,
provided that they themselves succeed in getting foremost
places—and children, chiefly young boys, whose parents
indulge them with mounts (no matter of what sort, provided
they have four legs to carry them) during the long Christmas
vacation, and who, with the fearlessness of ignorance, dash
hither and thither, without any regard whatever for their
own safety, much less for that of others.</p>

<p>One of the very worst falls I ever got in my life was caused
by a schoolboy on a pony. The little chap burst wildly
through a hedge close to Notley Abbey, where I happened
<a id="Page_169" href="#Page_169" class="pagenum" title="169"> </a>
to be waiting quietly, in hopes that the fox might break
that way—and, cannoning right against me, caught my horse
on the quarters, and turned him a complete somersault,
burying me beneath his weight. Fortunately there were
not many out, for it was a Chilton day, and the weather
was very boisterous; had things been otherwise I could not
have escaped being ridden over, for the game broke at the
precise instant of my fall, and the field, such as it was,
came streaming right over the fatal fence. On another
occasion, when down at the bottom of a deep drain, a
horsebreaker on a colossal mount tumbled crash on top
of me, and neither of us looked handsome when dragged
out—nor for a good many days after.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, manifest that however valuable skill and
good horseflesh may undoubtedly be, we are largely dependent
upon others for our safety, or its reverse, when we go
to hunt, and as Carlyle’s theory of “mostly fools” is never
in any place so clearly set forth as in the hunting-field, it
will be well not to go thither with an over-confident feeling
respecting our own powers, but rather to adopt the pithy
prayer of the old Hobb’s Hill huntsman, “From all bad
riders and wild horses, good Lord deliver us!”</p>

<p>I would have you bear in mind that it will be a grand
help to you upon all occasions to keep cool, to avoid flurry
and fuss, and above all things to steer clear of “funk,” which
is as bad as panic, or a trifle worse. It is the least flurried
riders who always come off the best, in two senses of the
word,—therefore, while falls are not by any means to be
made light of, they should be taken as coolly as possible, nor
<a id="Page_170" href="#Page_170" class="pagenum" title="170"> </a>
should demonstration of any sort ever be made over them.
I saw a lady get two falls one day with Sir Bache Cunard’s
pack at Holt Wood, and although her face was a sorry
sight when turning homewards after the last one, she
made infinitely less fuss about it than did an irrepressible
damsel who had merely scraped her cheek against a
thorn-bush.</p>

<p>You should never jump off at once when a horse bungles,
but keep steady in the middle of your saddle and give
him plenty of rein. Time enough for a <em>man</em> to show his
quickness when his knee touches the ground, and for a
lady in a similar predicament the best course will be to
sit still, deal him out unlimited rope, grip his mane firmly—leaving
his <em>mouth</em> alone—and ten to one he will recover
himself. Of course I am speaking now of the plan to be
pursued in case of a slow fall: one that is preceded by a
scramble—in fact, a “bungle” as I have chosen to call it.
When an animal comes down a weighty cropper, there is
seldom much time for reflection, or choice of action either;
the great point then is to come off as best you can.</p>

<p>To roll clear of the horse is the secret in most heavy
falls, and this can only be done where the foot is absolutely
free from the stirrup, and the habit from the pommels of the
saddle. For this reason I again most strongly advocate the
use of a plain racing-stirrup for ladies in the hunting-field,
as it has not any sort of machinery that can <em>possibly</em> get out
of order, and is therefore independent of the variable attentions
bestowed upon such matters by unthinking grooms.
A good plain stirrup, made large enough to release the
<a id="Page_171" href="#Page_171" class="pagenum" title="171"> </a>
foot, even if thrust “home,” is the safest and best in which
an equestrian can ever ride. I approve (as already stated)
of the spring-bar attachment, and think that every lady
before setting out to hunt ought to <em>see for herself</em> that
the spring is open. I know that this theory is not a
popular one among horsewomen, as they think it is apt to
entail the loss of a stirrup in a quick run; but this is an
error, for the stirrup-leather will seldom or never come
away if properly treated (by which I mean not leant upon)—except
in case of strong pressure being brought to bear
upon it, as, for instance, in the event of a fall. An accomplished
horsewoman will never ride from the stirrup, but
will use it merely as a support for the foot, and will be
altogether independent of it, even if entirely taken away.</p>

<p>With untrained riders it is, of course, different, and to
their churning motion in the saddle, and heavy hang upon
the stirrup-leather, one half the sore backs and other
sufferings to which ladies’ horses are liable, are altogether
attributable.</p>

<p>A habit-skirt, if properly constructed, cannot possibly
catch upon the pommels when the wearer receives a fall.
I have already given suitable instructions concerning the
cut of habits, and would here take occasion to say that a
marvellously improved plan, introduced by Thomas &amp; Sons,
of South Molton Street, has been lately shown me. It
consists of cutting the skirt with one seam less than usual,
and making it without any hem around the bottom. Of this
latter I greatly approve. It has frequently happened that
a skirt, when caught on the pommel, has torn downwards
<a id="Page_172" href="#Page_172" class="pagenum" title="172"> </a>
as far as the hem, and been there arrested, owing to
the resistance offered by the strength of the doubled cloth.
Where the hem is done away with, this danger ceases to
exist, and the skirt looks if anything better than those that
are finished in the ordinary way. I strongly recommend
the innovation.</p>

<p>The most dangerous fall that a lady can get is one into
a deep ditch, or drain, with her horse on top of her; the
least dangerous is when he comes down with her on the
flat, and gives her a chance to roll clear of him. The
best course to pursue in the first instance is to remain
perfectly quiet, provided the horse does so also, until
rescued. If your head happens to get under water, or that
you are in any physical suffering entailed by the position
in which you are placed, it will of course be incumbent
upon you to endeavour to extricate yourself from it, but
even in so awful a moment you should strive to remember
that a prostrate horse will be far less likely to injure you
than a struggling one, and that if you begin to move,
or to pull his head about (as I have seen some frightened
ladies do), he will probably make violent efforts to get
upon his feet, and may hurt you very severely before help
arrives.</p>

<p>If the place is very deep, and narrow at the bottom, and
that you are partially under the horse, strive for your life
to keep his head down, in order that he may not attempt
to rise, and so trample you in his endeavours. He cannot
get up so long as you can prevent his lifting his head;
therefore, if you can contrive to throw a leg across it, or an
<a id="Page_173" href="#Page_173" class="pagenum" title="173"> </a>
arm, or any other portion of your body, do so, but never
drag at the rein when in such a position. Strive if possible,
however, to retain a light hold of it, in order that, in the
event of the animal managing to regain his feet without
mischief, he may not get altogether away from you. Coolness
and courage will be the best companions upon so
trying an occasion.</p>

<p>When a thoroughly practised horsewoman gets a fall of
this description, it is generally through riding a beaten horse
at a place that is too big for his exhausted powers to carry
him safely over—an error into which almost all enthusiastic
riders are apt to be led; or it may occur through the
landing-ground being rotten, or broken away. When this
latter is the case, the horse’s hind legs slip from beneath
him, and he hangs for a dreadful moment, half-in, half-out
of the ravine, beating a frantic tattoo with his fore-feet
upon the brink, while the hinder ones struggle to find
something that may serve as an assistance against the
otherwise inevitable going back. A moment like this is
supremely dreadful for both horse and rider. The latter, if
a man, may swing himself off in the twinkling of an eye,
and jump on to the bank, keeping a hold of the bridle all
the while, and by it may assist his mount to regain <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra
firma</i> when he is safely landed there himself; I have seen
it done by smart horsemen over and over again,—but no
lady that ever entered a hunting-field can possibly do it
without a hand being stretched from the bank to assist her.</p>

<p>I recall instances, and think of them with horror, of
finding myself hanging over an abyss—for such it always
<a id="Page_174" href="#Page_174" class="pagenum" title="174"> </a>
seems to an excited fancy—watching my horse’s forelegs
striving to plant themselves, feeling the struggling quarters
seeking some help from below, seeing the scarlet nostril
laid level with the earth, the eager neck outstretched, the
panting muscles brought strongly into play—hearing the
anxious snort, dealing out abundant rein, and uttering
words of encouragement in the vain hope that the horse
may succeed in righting himself—conscious, nevertheless,
that he is sinking lower and lower, seeing then a friendly
hand outstretched to assist me, feeling the welcome grip of
it, clutching strongly at it as it drags me to the bank,
knowing that I have never let go the bridle during that
terrible moment of suspense, making use of it then to draw
my brave horse to a place of safety, looking down with a
shudder into the chasm from which we have both escaped,
and finally, with a laugh, and a <i>Laus</i> also, jumping merrily
into the saddle again, and scurrying away in the hope of
picking up the hounds.</p>

<p>But there came an instance of misadventure which ended
less happily—when there was no strong hand to rescue or
help—when the awful backward crash occurred only too
surely, and oblivion followed, to be succeeded in time by a
consciousness that for ever and ever the sight of happy
hunting-fields, and the sound of huntsman’s horn and
hounds’ joyful opening-out were gone away, to be known
no more on earth. Such things are sad awakenings from
sweet fitful dreams. I pray that all my young readers may
be spared them; and with more than one fate to warn, I
urge that discretion may at all times usurp the place of
<a id="Page_175" href="#Page_175" class="pagenum" title="175"> </a>
valour or ambition, and that no feat may be <em>attempted</em>
which will be likely to involve dire, if not fatal results.
Better be a live dog than a dead lion; and a few who are
now disabled would rather have their bodies intact to-day,
than have ever known the uncertain pleasures that are
attendant upon being Kings and Queens of an hour. I do
not say that it is so with myself. A short life and a merry
one is much more suited to my elastic temperament; but
there are others, young, beautiful women, whose feet have
only touched the threshold of life’s loveliest and brightest
doorway, who are nevertheless looking back—with tears.</p>

<p>To resume, however. The second description of fall on
which I have touched: namely, one on the flat, is only
dangerous according as the horse may or may not attempt
to roll when down. If he falls fairly on his knees and nose,
you may manage (as I have explained) to retain your seat
in the saddle, and may even assist him to get upon his
legs; many fine horsewomen do it: but if you try the
experiment you must not forget to sit <em>well</em> back, not only
in order to take the weight off his shoulders, but to save
yourself from getting knocked in the face. If you watch
the movements of a fallen animal, you will perceive that
at the instant that he steadies himself on his knees when
rising, he instinctively <em>flings up his head</em>, a motion absolutely
necessary for the restoration of his balance; if at
such a moment you happen to be leaning forward in the
saddle, you will be certain to receive severe punishment,
and perhaps be disabled for the remainder of the day.</p>

<p>If, in falling, the horse turns over upon his side, you cannot
<a id="Page_176" href="#Page_176" class="pagenum" title="176"> </a>
do any better than strive to get clear of him; but do not on
any account let go the rein if you can possibly help it. So
long as you can keep hold of it you will not only prevent
your mount from getting away over the country, but will
save yourself from possible contact with his heels, for
it stands to reason that he cannot have both his back and
fore-quarters turned to you at one and the same time, and
if you have a hold of his head he certainly cannot twist
himself round to kick at you. I know quite well that there
is an ignorant idea abroad relative to the danger of holding
on to the bridle of a fallen horse. “Let him go! let him
go!” shrieks the multitude, when any mishap is witnessed;
and the poor, unlearned, frightened rider follows the foolish
advice, and away goes the steed, with reins and stirrups
flying—lashing out, perhaps, in his exuberance at finding
himself free—and is perhaps not brought back until the
wearied owner has had to relinquish all hope of catching
up the hunt, and been compelled also to walk some miles
of the road homewards.</p>

<p>No, never if you can help it, relinquish your hold of the
bridle when you and your horse are together making the
acquaintance of mother earth, but remember the rule, “a
long rein,” even when not upon his back.</p>

<p>Should a horse peck with you, a very nasty kind of fall,
I tell you candidly that you will be almost certain to come
off over his head, unless you are sitting glued to your
saddle and very far back indeed; but, as this is a sort of
tumble which does not often happen, except when riding a
deep drop, or crossing something very wide, you may
<a id="Page_177" href="#Page_177" class="pagenum" title="177"> </a>
prepare yourself for possible contingencies when going at
the jump by allowing your body, from the waist upwards,
to lie back almost to the croup, while you deal out unlimited
rein, and keep your seat as firmly as any rock. In
this way you cannot possibly be pulled over the animal’s
head, and by leaving him plenty of bridle you will still
further stave off the probability of mischance.</p>

<p>When a horse falls with you into water, stick to him if
you possibly can, and clutch firmly by his mane, while
leaving him the entire length of the bridle. If you happen
to come right off, keep alongside of him as well as you are
able, retaining a light hold of the rein, and assisting yourself
by the saddle, the stirrup, or any other thing that may
present itself, provided it does not in any respect hamper
his movements or interfere with his mouth. I strongly
advocate keeping the bridle in your hand if you can possibly
manage it, but you should not on any account make use of
it as a means of support. To do so will be to drag your
horse’s head under water, a thing involving very serious
results. So long as you leave an animal abundant room to
stretch his neck he will not drown, even in the deepest
river, and if you keep a cool head, and assist yourself by
the saddle until you can lay hold of some side bushes, or
until assistance shall arrive, neither will you, however near
it you may fancy yourself to be.</p>

<p>When a horse falls with you into a ditch and immediately
regains his footing without unseating you, do not allow
him to essay getting out at the same spot at which he
bungled, for probably the bank may be rotten, or broken
<a id="Page_178" href="#Page_178" class="pagenum" title="178"> </a>
away by the hoofs of other horses, and may thus occasion
him to go back again. You should rather urge him
forward a little distance, in whichever direction his head is
turned, and as soon as your eye detects a sound spot in the
bank, collect him for his effort, throw him the reins, and sit
well back while he struggles up the side. I do not mean
that you are to <em>hang</em> back, this will only impede him,
but keep your head well away from him, or his may strike
you a blow that will take you a long time to forget.</p>

<p>Do not neglect, however, in the event of walking a horse
along a ditch which is skirted by thorn or hedge, to look
out for protruding brambles, and push them aside with your
hand as you go forward, lest your face suffer. On no
account neglect this precaution.</p>

<p>The instructions given in the present chapter will be
found especially applicable to ladies who are fond of cutting
out a line of country for themselves, or whose pilots
may either have got lost in the fray, or may not be sufficiently
quick in turning to the rescue to prove of any
immediate assistance in case of need.</p>

<p>In a forthcoming chapter on “hunting,” I shall have
something to say on each of these subjects.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />

<span class="chapter-title">HUNTING OUTFIT CONSIDERED.</span></h2>


<p>It is time that we should now consider the additions
and alterations which will be necessary for your wardrobe
before it can be pronounced a complete one for a lady who
intends to hunt.</p>

<p>A very great deal must, of course, depend upon whether
you mean to be an inveterate huntress, or only to enjoy
the pleasures of an occasional day out. Following the
hounds thrice a week, and sometimes oftener, I have found
the following outfit sufficient: two silk hats, two jerry
ditto, and two soft felt; two Melton cloth riding habits;
one thoroughly rainproof ditto; one ordinary cloth, for
mild days, such as are to be met with even in winter
time; two pairs of hunting breeches; six chemises; six pairs
of web drawers; six web vests; two corsets; two pairs of
Wellingtons; six pairs of fine wool stockings; six pairs of
silk ditto; one Latchford spur; three pairs of strong
leather gloves; one hunting crop, with long lash attached;
three net veils; one celluloid collar, with cuffs to match;
six linen collars and cuffs; two woollen neck-mufflers;
two silk ditto; one rainproof cape or jacket; one warm,
<a id="Page_180" href="#Page_180" class="pagenum" title="180"> </a>
lined jacket, to fit over habit-bodice; and one Newmarket
overcoat, to wear when driving to and from covert.</p>

<p>It will be only necessary to notice a few of these articles
in detail, having already given advice concerning most of
them. To begin, then, with stockings. Wear woollen
ones if you want to have your feet always dry and comfortable,
with a pair of silk drawn over. Nobody who has
not tried this plan can possibly realise the warmth and
comfort of it—especially when the outer stocking is of <em>spun</em>
silk; a material in itself almost as warm as wool. If the
sensation of wearing wool next the skin is objected to, the
silk may be worn underneath. As a rule, however, it is
only cheap wool stockings that “tickle”; the finer kinds
seldom do, and I cannot recommend the “cheap and
nasty” in any article of riding gear, no matter how comparatively
unimportant it may seem to be.</p>

<p>Your breeches for hunting should be especially well-made;
large enough in the seat not to burst in case of
a fall, and long enough in the thigh not in any way
to hamper the knees. Nothing save a garment of this
description can be worn with top boots, nor will anything
else do so well for hunting, or be half so comfortable.
They should be carried below the calf of the
leg, in order to check the tendency to work up, and
ought to have the last four or five inches made of silk, or
better still, good serviceable satin, by which I certainly
do <em>not</em> mean the abomination known as cotton-back,
which in reality gives no wear at all. This arrangement
will prevent the top of the boot (a Wellington, of
<a id="Page_181" href="#Page_181" class="pagenum" title="181"> </a>
course), from being overcrowded or bulky, and is in fact,
for many reasons, a desirable one. The legs of the
breeches should button from the knee down—four buttons
being ample to allow—and the fastening of the right leg
should be on the inside, while that of the left is on the
outside, in order to prevent rubs. These breeches, if made
of cloth, should be lined with chamois; but I prefer deer-skin
to any other kind.</p>

<p>With regard to securing perfection in the fit of them—a
thing indispensable where comfort is desired—it will not
be at all necessary to submit to a tailor’s measurements.
Very few ladies indeed would like to do so, and it is
pleasant to know that nothing of the kind is required.
Application to any <em>first-class</em> house will bring back the
necessary directions, simply given, for self-measurement,
and by paying attention to these and forwarding the
precise particulars, a perfect fit will be ensured. In saying
this, I would draw attention to the words printed in italics,
for there is no other article of ladies’ riding apparel which
can be, and so frequently is, utterly and completely ruined
by incompetent cutters. I have heard ladies say that
they made their own hunting-breeches and found them
answer very well. No doubt they may do so, by ripping
up an old tailor-made pair, and proceeding to cut out
exactly by them; but that they can succeed in the first
instance without a pattern to go by, I cannot bring myself
to believe, any more than I can credit the expediency of
home millinery and dressmaking, except when attempted
by unusually clever and competent hands.</p>
<a id="Page_182" href="#Page_182" class="pagenum" title="182"> </a>

<p>I do not like riding <i>trousers</i> for hunting, although many
are wedded to a firm belief in them. If adopted, they must,
of absolute necessity, be the exact colour of the habit, must
be made long enough to allow even fuller freedom to the
knees than in ordinary riding, and be fastened beneath the
arch of the foot with a <i>leather</i> strap (always leather for
hunting purposes), although elastic is in some respects not
to be despised, inasmuch as it yields easily with pressure,
and is consequently not altogether undesirable when the
trousers have been made too short in the legs. It very
soon wears out, however, as stated in a former chapter,
requires constant renewing, and is unpleasantly apt to give
way when least expected to behave badly—very often on
hunting days, or when a long distance from home—and then
good-bye to everything save extreme discomfort, for the
trouser-leg will assuredly ruck up, and a good many lady
riders—and, indeed, gentlemen also—have a disagreeable
knowledge of what that means.</p>

<p>I now come to speak again of boots, a subject on which
I have already given some advice. The so-called fashionable
boot—an awful invention, utterly misshapen, with toe
narrow and pointed, and long heel protruding like a spike
from almost the centre of the sole—must be altogether discarded.
It is to be hoped that this will not go hard with
sensible girls, or women. Nobody can ride with comfort
who is not prepared to lay aside <em>all</em> cherished prejudices in
favour of cramped feet, hour-glass waists, and gloves that are
two sizes too small for the hands they are meant to protect.
I do not believe that anybody really admires a stuffed doll
<a id="Page_183" href="#Page_183" class="pagenum" title="183"> </a>
on horseback. The elegance of the figure depends upon its
flexibility, and a supple foot is in its own way quite as
much to be commended. If the boots are too tight, the feet
will be cold; nothing on earth conduces so largely to that
oft-complained-of evil as wearing boots that are disproportionately
small and close-fitting. The foot should be
able to move freely within its covering, even though clad in
the double stocking which I have so confidently recommended.
A broad sole, wide toe, and flat broad heel, placed
properly back, as far as the natural heel, are the requisites
for a comfortable riding-boot.</p>

<p>I have already drawn attention to the fact that a considerable
distance has sometimes to be walked in boots that have
been made, ostensibly, for riding in alone. For example, a
horse may get away from his rider after a fall, and leave her to
walk across several fields—over very rough ground perhaps—ay,
and to climb fences, and get through rutty gaps too,
before arriving at a point at which he can be brought up for
her to remount him; while, in addition to all this, a gentle-hearted
equestrian will often of her own accord like to get
off, when taking a tired horse home to his stable, and will
walk alongside of him with the bridle thrown over her arm, a
piece of humanity which eases her own limbs as well as his.
To have comfortable pliant boots, and everything else proportionately
easy-fitting, will be found both healthy and
wise. In short, a lady dressed for riding ought to be able
<em>when</em> dressed to take down or put up her hair, draw off her
boots and put them on again, and walk a mile or two <em>with</em>
them on, if required, without feeling any desire whatever to
<a id="Page_184" href="#Page_184" class="pagenum" title="184"> </a>
remove them after the exercise. This—if it will only be
believed—can be accomplished without any unsightly clumsiness,
or necessity for making feet or figure look in the
least degree larger than if tortured and compressed into
unnatural proportions. Well-made clothing, composed of
pliant materials and properly put on, will never impart an
appearance of bulk, even if worn sufficiently easy-fitting to
be slipped on and off at a moment’s notice; while ill-cut
garments, unnaturally strained and tightened, will make
figure and extremities look absolutely larger than they
really are. Who, for instance, that has ever seen a No. 6
glove stretched upon a hand that ought to take at least
four sizes larger has ever been deceived into believing
that there was not something painfully amiss? Straining
seams, fingers only half drawn on, and ominous gaps,
yawning and wide, where the first buttons ought to fasten,
attest the “vanity of vanities” against which we have
been warned. With boots and corsets it is just the same,—and
yet, despite the uncontrovertible evidence brought to
bear upon the matter, ladies still persist in destroying the
symmetry of their appearance, undermining their health,
and leaving themselves exposed to disparaging observations,
rather than give up the follies into which an undue desire
to appear “slim” have by degrees drawn them. After all,
when we come to consider the subject, is it really worth
while to undergo suffering and inconvenience in order that
one or two persons may, perhaps, say, “That girl has small
feet”; or “What a slender waist that lady has?” Ten to
one the utterers of such remarks never think a second time
<a id="Page_185" href="#Page_185" class="pagenum" title="185"> </a>
about them, but turn away to make their comments upon
the next person who chances to come in their path—and
for this trifling gratification, distress and pain are borne,
and the seeds of inward disease are in some instances
suffered to take root. If anything that I can say, in this
or future chapters, shall have even a trifling influence in
deterring my sisters from destroying the natural attributes
which a wise Creator has apportioned to them, I shall
deem myself happy in having written it, and feel that my
efforts have not been altogether in vain.</p>

<p>The Newmarket coat, for going to covert, is, I think, the
only article of which I have not now fully spoken. The nicest
of these are made of dark strong melton, or beaver cloth—the
latter wears splendidly—and are lined all through with <em>good</em>
satin, being well quilted about the bodice to keep out the
cold. Some ladies affect the coachmen’s garment, a drab
coat, with double capes, but I have a strong objection to it
myself. The collar should be made pretty deep, so as to
be capable of turning up about the neck in wet or chilly
weather, and the skirts should come quite down to the feet.
It is almost superfluous to say that an overcoat of this
description should be cut so as to fit very easily over the
habit, nor need I add that the task of fitting should be
entrusted to none save a really first-class tailor.</p>

<p>Ladies have frequently inquired of me, by letter and otherwise,
what ought to be the price of various articles of riding
apparel. Indeed, to judge by the number of communications
which have from time to time reached me, a great
and stirring interest appears to be centred in the matter,
<a id="Page_186" href="#Page_186" class="pagenum" title="186"> </a>
and the fact that I at times delay answering the multitude
of writers who ask questions and beg for immediate replies
is not really attributable to any discourtesy, but is rather
the result of over-work, coupled with a sense of difficulty in
detailing the average cost of a variety of articles which are
manufactured in every quality—good, bad, and indifferent—the
cheapest, or lowest priced, being in all cases the dearest
in the end. A thoroughly good article will look respectable
to the very last bit, while a cheap one can never be made
to do so at all. I can, for my own part, see no virtue in
the so-called “bargains” in which many ladies are so
curiously fond of investing. I use the word “curiously”
advisedly, for to me it is most strange how sensible practical
women, who on most subjects have their wits well
about them, are nevertheless afflicted with a positive craze
for bargain-hunting, and are willing to bear any amount of
pushing and trampling upon, in slummy shops with “Selling
off” emblazoned in large letters all over the windows,
for the very doubtful satisfaction of carrying home some
three or four pairs of half-soiled gloves at one shilling per
pair, or a few yards of mildewed ribbon at something very
much too dear for it.</p>

<p>The <em>average</em> cost of riding gear, every article being of
the best and finest description, may be thus set down. Silk
hats, from £1 1<i>s.</i> each; jerry ditto, 14<i>s.</i>; soft felt, 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>;
melton riding habits, £12 12<i>s.</i> each; rainproof ditto,
£10 10<i>s.</i>; ordinary cloth, £10 10<i>s.</i>; summer cloth, £8 8<i>s.</i>;
gingham or holland, £5 5<i>s.</i>; riding breeches, £4 4<i>s.</i> per
pair; buckskin, £6 6<i>s.</i> to £8 8<i>s.</i>; trousers (chamois lined),
<a id="Page_187" href="#Page_187" class="pagenum" title="187"> </a>
from £2 2<i>s.</i> to £3 3<i>s.</i> Chemises, 8<i>s.</i> each. Web drawers
(silk), £1 10<i>s.</i> per pair; (cotton), 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; vests (silk),
£1 1<i>s.</i> each; (cotton), 5<i>s.</i> Corsets (satin), £4 4<i>s.</i>; sateen
(red), £2 10<i>s.</i>; sateen (white), £2 2<i>s.</i> Wellington boots,
£3 3<i>s.</i> per pair. Wool stockings, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; pure silk, ditto,
16<i>s.</i>; spun silk, 6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Latchford spur (plated), £1 1<i>s.</i>;
japanned, 9<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Gloves, 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per pair. Celluloid
collar and cuffs, 4<i>s.</i> Rainproof jacket, £2 2<i>s.</i> Cape,
£1. Warm over-jacket, with braiding, £6 6<i>s.</i> Newmarket
covert-coat, from £10 to £12. It would be impossible
to lay down any rule for the price of whips, as much
must necessarily depend upon the mounting; but I have
always thought that with them, as with all other articles
of riding apparel, the plainer they are the better. A good
hunting-whip with long lash attached averages from
£1 10<i>s.</i> upwards.</p>

<p>Every article that I have named may be had at a very
much lower price; in fact for half (or even less) the ordinary
cost that I have set down, but the question of course
remains, “Are cheap things, as a rule, worth purchasing?”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<span class="chapter-title">ECONOMY IN RIDING DRESS.</span></h2>


<p>To economise well is a great art, and unfortunately very
few persons understand it. The public mind wavers as a rule
between two views of the matter—excessive parsimony, or
continual hunting after cheap things. When I say “cheap,”
I mean low-priced; for brummagem articles, no matter of
what description, are always the very reverse of <em>cheap</em>. “I
have got such a bargain,” says one dear friend to another,
displaying some trumpery thing which would have been
dear at half the price given for it; and away goes the
friend and invests in a similar treasure, only to regret her
want of wisdom when too late to retract.</p>

<p>The true secrets of economising are: first never to buy
anything that you do not absolutely require; second, to
purchase every article of the very best description; and
third, to take care of your things when you have got them.
These three rules will go far if attended to, but, like the
Siamese twins, separate them and they will die. A word,
then, about each—taking them in rotation as named.</p>

<p>Buy nothing that you do not want. It is a general
weakness with ladies to infringe this rule. They are fond
of shopping, and shopmen know it, and pander to the familiar
<a id="Page_189" href="#Page_189" class="pagenum" title="189"> </a>
infirmity—not only detaining them twice as long as is
necessary at every counter, but showing them an endless
variety of articles, by way of tempting them to buy. The
artifice succeeds only too often, and the consequences are
a lightened purse, and an unnecessarily burdened wardrobe.</p>

<p>To have too large a stock of clothes is in every way a
mistake. They become old-fashioned before they are half
worn out; they encourage and engender moths; they form
a cumbrous baggage if compelled to move; and they are a
source of embarrassment and trouble if taken away with
one on visits—seeing that in this age a lady rarely enjoys
the luxury of a wardrobe in her bedroom, except in her
own house. Most of us consider such a commodity a
necessity when at home, but when we go visiting it is a
luxury absolutely denied us. I do not mean to say that
there is not an imposing piece of furniture so styled in the
sleeping apartment allotted to us; there almost always is;
it looks quite magnificent, generally, with its shining panels
and tempting mirrored centre—but, alas, it is a delusion
and a snare! We find that the doors are immovable: they
are locked; the hostess has it filled with her own fineries,
and has either forgotten to remove them, or has said to
herself that it would be too great a trouble to do so: the
visitor can manage very well without it—has she not got her
imperials, and the bed-rail—and the drawers of the toilet-table
to keep her brushes and things in, and what more
can she reasonably want? To say that this is not the way
in good houses is both foolish and untrue; for it is so in the
very best. It may be the fault of my lady’s maid, or housekeeper—probably
<a id="Page_190" href="#Page_190" class="pagenum" title="190"> </a>
it is, in many instances—but it is my
lady’s fault in a great measure also, inasmuch as she has
neither seen to the comforts of her guest, nor made inquiries
concerning them. However this may be, or with
whomsoever the fault may lie, the wardrobe is a sealed
book, into which we are not permitted to peer, and so we
cast our despairing eyes around us for some substitute,
and brighten as we perceive a tempting-looking chest of
drawers; but it likewise is a deception, for it is found to
contain articles of children’s clothing folded away in the
top receptacles, while the lower ones have toilet linen in
them, and the big deep one at the bottom contains a bolster
doubled in two, like a huge sausage put away to keep.
This being the case, we shake a dismal head, and proceed
to lay out our neat habit-skirts and other things on the bed-rail,
and on the backs of the chairs; and by-and-by, when
we return to our room to dress for dinner, we find that a
remorseful hostess, or a conscience-stricken maid, has unlocked
one of the mighty doors of the mysterious “sealed
book,” and has graciously crammed three or four satin
gowns on to one of the back pegs, leaving the front ones
free to hold whatever we may be pleased to hang upon
them. Sometimes even this small boon is not vouchsafed,
and we run the tether of our visit with only chair-backs to
depend upon for hanging purposes, and with the cheerful
consciousness that all the maids in the establishment have
tried on and admired themselves in every single article
belonging to us for which we have been unable to find
room in our trunks. I once caught a smart abigail in an
<a id="Page_191" href="#Page_191" class="pagenum" title="191"> </a>
English house pirouetting before the cheval-glass, dressed
in my riding-breeches, and grinning delightedly, with a hand
on each side of her waist. By way of punishment, I made
her divest herself of the trifles in my presence, and by so
doing found that she had augmented the evil by making
an entirely wrong use of one of my silk vests—while as
an end to all bitterness, she had actually fitted on my
stockings and boots.</p>

<p>It being then an established fact that a superabundance
of clothing is both an encumbrance and an extravagance
which leads to waste, I think I have succeeded in
proving that the first on my list of theories—namely, to
buy nothing that is not absolutely required—is at least
worthy of consideration. Of course, there is no rule that
has not an exception, and there may be times—although
they come but rarely—when there will be a perceptible advantage
in purchasing clothing in advance: for example,
when one is obliged to go for a lengthened period to some
out-of-the-way place where things are absolutely not obtainable.
In such, or similar cases, the regulation practice
may be broken through, although even then it will be
better, if possible, to secure the services of a friend who
will purchase and send them out according as they are
required.</p>

<p>The second point on which I have given advice—namely,
to buy none save the best articles—is one upon which
I must resolutely hold by my opinion, despite the fact
that my expression of it in a sporting journal in which,
some time ago, I quoted a list of probable prices, called
<a id="Page_192" href="#Page_192" class="pagenum" title="192"> </a>
down upon me such a vortex of letters—some of inquiry,
others upon the extravagance of my ideas—that I fairly
sat down under the shower in a state of bewilderment,
and felt that the only way in which I could reply to
such a multitude, or at all hope to satisfy them, was to
select the first opportunity of writing a disquisition on
economy—the present venture being the result.</p>

<p>I have, as stated, been repeatedly and anxiously pressed
to say what I thought the price of sundry articles of
riding-gear ought to be, and as the subject was a difficult
one to propound, have thought it best to give the
amount usually paid for goods of first-class description,
leaving it, of course, to the intelligence of the reader
to surmise (even when not plainly stated) that prices
vary according to quality, and acknowledging that it is
quite possible for a lady to furnish herself with a complete
hunting outfit at a very much lower scale of
charges than that which I cited in my last. It is just
a question of how long she expects her things to wear,
and how well she expects them to look when the first
gloss (always an arrant deceiver) has worn off them.
Low-priced articles never stand the test; they may look
fairly well to the eye when first put on, but time and
weather place a stamp upon them with which the owner
cannot but feel disappointed. Take a few examples. It
seems to many a great extravagance to give a seemingly
high price for a riding-hat, when at half the shops in
town a fairly good-looking one can be bought for half
the money. Quite true. But place the two hats side by
<a id="Page_193" href="#Page_193" class="pagenum" title="193"> </a>
side together after a hard season’s continual wear and tear,
and see whether the Lincoln and Bennet or Madame White
will not be bravely holding its own, when the other is only
fit for the dustman’s cart. In like manner, you may purchase
a riding habit for five guineas,—I have seen them
made to order scores of times at that price—but I have
never <em>yet</em> seen one of such articles able to hold up its head
after immersion in a muddy stream, while very many of
them could not even stand a heavy shower of rain without
showing spots or “cockles,” or both. Then, again, you
can get a Newmarket covert coat for £3—not at all a
bad-looking one either—quite a jaunty article, in fact; a
neat plaid if you like it, and gorgeous big buttons if your
fancy happens to turn that way,—but just think of the
seams that are all machine-stitched, ready to act shabbily
by you at the most inconvenient moments, and of the
uncertain nature of the material, which is dreadfully wont
to wear “tender” in highly important places: under the
arms, for instance, and where the collar fastens in front;
and of the awful moments which you will have to endure,
tugging hard at it, or getting somebody else to do so, in
order to work it off; and think of the still more painful
and embarrassing ordeal that awaits you in endeavouring
to draw it over your habit-bodice, to which it seems to
cling as provokingly as though birdlime had been scattered
over both,—all because it has not any nice, smooth,
slippery satin lining to make it slide easily over the garment
that it is meant to cover. Even if perchance your
persuasions have induced the maker of the wonderful
<a id="Page_194" href="#Page_194" class="pagenum" title="194"> </a>
thing to augment its monetary value by the insertion of
a satin lining in the bodice, you perceive with horror, after
an incredibly short period of time, that the silk facing has
completely worn off it, and that long stretches of discoloured
cotton threads are intersecting the fabric in every
inconvenient direction.</p>

<p>With boots and gloves it is just the same; you can get
them very cheap. I have seen capital-looking boots in
shop windows ticketed eight shillings per pair, and gloves
1<i>s.</i> 6½<i>d.</i> (always a ha’penny, when it is not three farthings),
and I have no doubt that plenty of people buy them—they
must do so, or such things would not be so numerous; but
an important query remains behind: namely, how long can
these articles be made to last—even such of them as look
moderately decent at the first go-off?</p>

<p>There are, however, without doubt, very many ways in
which small economies may be justifiably practised, with
results by no means discreditable to the appearance of
even the most dashing equestrian. If, then, you want to
appear at all times fairly well turned out, and yet cannot
command sufficient capital from your dress allowance to
enable you to extend your custom to first-class houses, you
can take a “tip” or two from the following hints:—</p>

<p>Look carefully over the columns of the various leading
journals which contain an “exchange and mart,” and
you will be almost certain to see some advertisements of
riding habits made by high-class makers and only worn a
few times—occasionally never worn at all, and only parted
with because the owner has been compelled to give up
<a id="Page_195" href="#Page_195" class="pagenum" title="195"> </a>
riding, or is going away. If the size of the waist seems to
suit you, answer without delay, and if, when sent on approval,
you find that the cut and quality are good, close at
once with the bargain, and get such alterations effected in
the article as may happen to be required. I have known
one or two ladies with very moderate dress allowances who
secured really excellent riding habits in this way,—but, of
course, everything will depend upon the maker; a high-class
house rarely or never turns out an indifferent cloth,
and the cut is certain to be good.</p>

<p>Again, you may be able to borrow a pair of well-made
riding trousers from some intimate lady friend, and if you
are smart and can make a couple of pairs for your own use
by the pattern lent you, it will be a great saving of expense.
Breeches will be more difficult to accomplish successfully: in
fact, I regard the cutting of them by amateurs as very nearly
impossible, so perhaps they had better not be attempted:
but, with proper self-measurements and a good pattern before
you, I can see no reason why comfortable riding-trousers
should not be creditably turned out. When making these,
cut the linings for the different parts the exact size of the
various pieces, and take care to tack piece and lining together
before running up the whole. If this is not done you will
experience great difficulty in adjusting the linings when the
garment has been put together—indeed, you will probably
fail completely, for it is a most difficult thing to do, and
the plan I have named is a very good one, although the
seams cannot (when it is adopted) look quite as neat on
the inside as if a tailor had had the doing of the job. If
<a id="Page_196" href="#Page_196" class="pagenum" title="196"> </a>
you want to avoid the trouble of arranging linings at all,
procure some strong soft chamois leather, make your
trousers of it, and cover them from a short distance above
the knee with cloth similar in colour to that of which your
habit is composed. Use silk thread for seam-sewing—strong,
and of the best quality—and when putting on the buttons
wind the thread round and round the stems after you have
stitched them firmly to the garment, so as to form a sort of
artificial shank; then fasten off very securely upon the
wrong or inner side.</p>

<p>If your resources are extremely limited, do not buy silk
hats at all. Low-priced ones are mere delusions, and it
will be better for you to invest the amount usually given
for second-rate articles—say from 12<i>s.</i> to 15<i>s.</i>—in a good,
serviceable felt, or billycock, which will stand a large
amount of ordinary knocking about.</p>

<p>By wearing riding trousers instead of breeches you can
dispense with Wellingtons, and be content with ordinary
boots; anything that you can walk comfortably in will do,
but remember I do not believe that any woman has ever
yet been able conscientiously to say that she walked “comfortably,”
or indeed otherwise than miserably, in narrow-waisted,
high-heeled boots, with toes an inch wide (or something
less) at the tip. A street or two may be traversed in
such articles without actual pain, or any perceptible show
of inconvenience, but a walk of five miles will probably
necessitate the services of a chiropodist, while half the
distance will show a decidedly altered gait.</p>

<p>The third item of advice which I have given you, namely
<a id="Page_197" href="#Page_197" class="pagenum" title="197"> </a>
to take good care of your things when you have them,
is one to which you will do well to take heed. Negligence
concerning the guardianship of one’s wearing apparel
generally proceeds from one of two causes: either from a
natural carelessness of disposition, which leads to all sorts
of shiftless and untidy ways; or to a foolish desire—if
among wealthy or showy people—to affect an air of indifference
concerning <em>cost</em>. I have seen examples of both
these dispositions; a girl who just stepped out of her riding-gear,
and left it there behind her, habit wet and muddy, hat
spotted with rain, veil never folded, boots flung anywhere,
whip and gloves in different corners, sometimes in different
rooms, or on the hall table, to be certainly missing when
next wanted to be used: a sort of girl who kept jam-pots
in her press, and matches in her work-box, and who <em>rooted</em>
for everything she wanted, precisely as a dog does when
burying a bone.</p>

<p>On the whole, however, I am not quite certain whether
she is not preferable to one of the vainer sort, who strides
over sharp stones, and plunges in and out of muddy pools
when there is any distance to be walked, rather than have
it supposed that she is picking her way in order to save
her boots; who eats bread-and-butter without removing her
gloves, for reasons of a similar sort; and who puts on a
smile of unconcern when her hostess’s lap-dog makes a
meal off her whip-lash, or mistakes the handle of it for
a bone.</p>

<p>Few things are more to be avoided than a studied carefulness
about matters of costume—when others are by,—the
<a id="Page_198" href="#Page_198" class="pagenum" title="198"> </a>
practice, for instance, of tucking up a mantle rather
than sitting upon it—of smoothing the back of the skirt
before taking a seat—of guarding the hands from contact
with any object that may possibly impart a soil to the
gloves—and so forth, all of which are signs of lack of
breeding, and are, as a rule, peculiar to persons unaccustomed
to mix in society,—but the opposite extreme
is quite as little to be admired. The best bred are those
who appear wholly unconscious of having anything on that
is worth fussing about: just as the best <em>dressed</em> are invariably
those upon whose costume no onlooker would ever
pass a remark.</p>

<p>To have a set place for everything is economy of both
time and substance: you will then know precisely where
to look and where to find. You should have neat trees
made for your boots, and insist upon the regular use of
them being observed. Brush your riding-habit carefully
yourself, unless you have a maid who can be trusted to do
it properly: namely, in a downward direction always, and
never from hand to hand. Should it be wet, hang it
in a cool, dry place, but not close to a fire—and place a
stick across the skirt on the inside, in order to aid the
drying process. Do not attempt to brush off mud spots
until the cloth is perfectly dry.</p>

<p>Stretch your gloves upon block hands, made the size and
shape of your own, and if they have been wet, be all the
more careful about doing so. Make a frequent inspection
of the stitching of them, and mend with a fine needle
and silk any portions that may have given way, or
<a id="Page_199" href="#Page_199" class="pagenum" title="199"> </a>
seem likely to do so. Look to the buttons also, in order
that you may not be inconvenienced at unexpected
times.</p>

<p>If you wear a silk riding-hat, never be induced to allow
an iron to touch it, except when wielded by a professional
hand. You can renew it yourself by wiping it very lightly
with a sponge just dipped in warm water, going carefully
round and round, always the one way. When the hat is
dry, brush it gently with a very soft brush, and finish with
a silk handkerchief.</p>

<p>A black veil that has become discoloured by dust may
be restored by dipping it a few times in cold water, shaking
the wet from it, and stretching it neatly out upon a rail or
line to dry. It will not require any ironing if nicely picked
out with the fingers. Another way is to put the veil, when
damp, between two soft cloths—old lawn handkerchiefs
will do—and pat it smoothly out with the hands, leaving it
then to dry without hanging.</p>

<p>Your celluloid collar and cuffs will wash beautifully in
your basin, and will require no making-up, beyond a light
wiping with the towel on which you dry your hands. The
material is a marvellous invention, introduced by our friends
across the silver streak, and is invaluable to equestrians
in wet weather, as it never becomes limp after rain: a
great improvement upon linen in this respect, as in many
others also.</p>

<p>To conclude my list of economies: If you cannot afford
the price of silk drawers and vests, fine cotton ones in
summer, and merino in winter, will make good substitutes;
<a id="Page_200" href="#Page_200" class="pagenum" title="200"> </a>
but silk is not an extravagance in the long run—it wears
so well and feels so delicious next the skin. Silk underclothing
of all kinds is a great luxury, and considering the
benefits that arise from the use of it, I question much
whether ladies of even very moderate incomes will, at the
end of twelve months, find themselves any the poorer for
investing in it.</p>

<p>If silk stockings are thought too dear for wearing under
or over cotton ones—and certainly they are an expensive
item of dress—fine cotton ones will do very well; but
there are few ladies who do not possess a supply of silk for
dinner and evening wear—and these, when old, or deficient
in colour and freshness, will serve the purpose quite as well
as new ones.</p>

<p>While on the subject of “colour” it will not be amiss to
give a hint or two about the proper method of washing
silk and woollen underclothing. Silk stockings, vests,
chemises, pocket-handkerchiefs, and so forth, ought to be
washed as follows:—Mix six tablespoonfuls of bran with
four quarts of water, put it to boil, and stir while boiling.
When ready, pour into a tub, place the articles in it, and
move them lightly about with a stick until the water is
cool enough to bear the hand; then wash rapidly in the
usual way, but without using soap. Rinse in three or four
waters, hang out to drain in a bright, dry atmosphere, and
iron while damp, placing a piece of fine muslin between
the iron and the article on which it is used. This receipt
will be found to answer admirably also for white flannels
or woollens. For coloured ones the water must be in a
<a id="Page_201" href="#Page_201" class="pagenum" title="201"> </a>
lukewarm state. Neither silk nor woollen garments should
ever be wrung.</p>

<p>On the subject of corsets I have from time to time
received a vast number of letters, most of them wailing over
my well-known abhorrence of cheap goods. Surely the
matter is one of which ladies ought to be able to judge
for themselves. I did not know that it was possible to
obtain a really good corset, made specially for one’s-self, of
best materials, and by a superior artist, for less money than
I am accustomed to quote,—nor do I believe that it is. At
the same time, corsets (like everything else) will be found
ready manufactured in various qualities, and at different
rates of charge. I have seen windows full of them in
London, and even at expensive Eastbourne and Bournemouth,
ticketed 1<i>s.</i> 11½<i>d.</i>! After this, who need complain
of prices? The papers teem with advertisements of “ready-made
corsets” of all patterns and descriptions, and I have
heard many persons say that they have found them answer
perfectly well. This being the case, I cannot see why the
articles should not be given a trial, or why ladies of limited
resources, and with figures easily fitted, should pay two or
three guineas for a corset, when “perfect treasures,” or, at
all events, something that will suit quite well (and that will
not go to pieces all at once), can by all accounts be had
for less than an eighth of the sum.</p>

<p>I once went to a famous London oculist, to consult him
about the right sort of glasses to be used for extreme
short-sightedness, and was quite prepared for his prescribing
some rather costly affairs; but, to my surprise,
<a id="Page_202" href="#Page_202" class="pagenum" title="202"> </a>
he said, very pleasantly, “Just go to an optician and suit
<em>yourself</em>. Don’t mind what <em>he</em> says; select something that
you can see well through, and that does not in any way
distress your sight, or cause your eyes to feel <em>on the
strain</em>. Years ago,” he added, “I found that I wanted
glasses myself, and coming across an old man sitting at
the corner of a street with a tray of them before him, I
chose a pair <em>for a shilling</em>, and I’m wearing them now.”</p>

<p>On this excellent principle I advise corset-buyers to act.
Purchase what <em>suits</em> you, and if your means are limited, do
not trouble about any particular maker, or price.</p>

<p>To wind up, never be ashamed to exercise a reasonable
and honest economy. There are really very few among us
who do not require to practice it, especially during these
difficult times—and there is not anything to blush for in
the fact. It is a very false shame indeed which induces us
to launch out into extravagances that we can ill afford,
rather than say candidly, “I must content myself with
something cheaper.” Believe me, there is more shame in
owing an honest tradesman five shillings, than in wearing
cheap corsets, cotton stockings, and mended gloves—in
place of the better or costlier ones which that same five
shillings would have helped to buy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

<span class="chapter-title">HACKS AND HUNTERS.</span></h2>


<p>I am wonderfully fond of a good hack, and very wroth at
times that ladies will persist in mistaking the meaning of the
term, and in thinking that it signifies something that is meant
to be abused. They take this idea, I have no doubt, from
expressions associated with their childhood: hacking out
their clothes, for instance,—in other words, abusing them.
“Don’t throw it away, it will do very well for a hack,”
meaning for very hard usage on second or third-rate
occasions. Such a thing as a <em>valuable</em> hack, one not on
any account to be subjected to rough treatment, they have
never believed in, or, indeed, thought about at all. I was
once bemoaning the loss of a favourite of this description
to a lady acquaintance, and although she pretended to
sympathise with me, I heard her, when I turned my back,
say, “What a fuss over a thing that had <em>come</em> to being
a hack! Not worth fourpence, most likely.”</p>

<p>Now, it is for ladies who do not know much about hacks,
yet who want to learn, that I am writing this chapter.
The subject is a very useful one, and might be readily
enlarged upon, but I shall be as concise as possible.</p>

<p>Hacks in the olden days were capable of immense hardship;
<a id="Page_204" href="#Page_204" class="pagenum" title="204"> </a>
the distances they travelled, the weights they carried,
the amount of endurance they displayed, would be deemed
marvellous in the present century, and cruel if put to the
test. Such animals—and they are very rare—are only now
to be met with in the stables of stirring farmers of the
wealthy class, who go over their lands before breakfast, and
overlook hundreds of acres on the backs of these useful
creatures. Occasionally, too, they are to be found with
country doctors, well-to-do parsons, and others whose daily
work cannot be accomplished on animals less enduring
or strong; but the ordinary seeker looks for them almost
in vain.</p>

<p>A good hack is a most trustworthy companion. His
rider may drop the reins to him on the very worst roads,
and yet feel certain that he will put his feet in precisely the
right places, and make no mistakes. His fore-feet are
always well formed, and whatever the pace may be they
fall straight, and flat, and even upon the ground. His
action when trotting is from the shoulders, his fore-legs
working strictly from them, and just sufficiently bent to
enable the rider to see his knees as they are raised, but not
to see under them. Chin-knocking action may do for a
park hack, but not for a roadster; indeed, I don’t admire
it myself in any class of horse, but in a covert-hack it is
decidedly objectionable. The wonder of my life is how
so many extraordinary goers, such as one sees throughout
every hunting season, contrive to jig along, or jog, or
pound, as the case may be, without coming down like
logs upon the ground; but they do: just as drunken
<a id="Page_205" href="#Page_205" class="pagenum" title="205"> </a>
men, though staggering, manage to get home without a
fall.</p>

<p>The paces of a thoroughly good hack are characterised
by perfect regularity and ease; his shoulders are well set,
sloping, and strong; his feet well formed, his back somewhat
short, his loins muscular, and his hips wide. The
shoulders at the withers are thick and firm—their tops
well back—and a good long space between the pommel of
the saddle and the termination of the mane.</p>

<p>Fore-leg action of the proper sort is an actual necessity
in a hack intended for a lady to ride, because the safety of
the rider is dependent upon it; but in selecting such an
animal look to his hind-leg action as well. If the hock
joints do not, when moving, seem <em>pliable</em>, and as though
they were bent with perfect ease, bringing his hind legs <em>well</em>
forward, reject him at once, no matter how good his front
action, or how perfect his forehand may appear.</p>

<div class="side-by-side">
  <div class="figcenter w250">

  </div>

  <div class="figcenter w250">
    <img src="images/illus-206-2.jpg" width="239" height="400" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><p>HOCK—TOO FAR BACK.</p></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Good hocks are clear, sharp, and well-defined in their
outline, with bones large and prominent, denoting a similar
condition of the muscles. When too much bent there is
generally a liability to sprain, and when placed very far
back there is, as a rule, an absence of propelling power. I
like to see hocks in such a position as shows that they are
right under the centre of gravity. This always enables a
horse to propel himself with confidence, and to bring his
hind-legs properly under him in the trot—at which pace
they should be carried as far forward as they can well be,
without hitting the fore-feet. An animal that sticks his
hind toes in the ground, and walks gingerly, as though his
<a id="Page_206" href="#Page_206" class="pagenum" title="206"> </a>
hocks had not any joints, will never be safe or pleasant to
ride. If he possesses strength and evenness of hind-leg
action, his paces will always be agreeable. Good shoulder
action and far-reaching hind legs will ensure delightful ease
and pleasure to the rider. Racehorses, when trotting over
turf, carry their hind feet far before the front ones—and
outside them too, as I have proved by footprints—although
some persons have flatly contradicted me about the matter.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus-207.jpg" width="258" height="400" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>HOCK—GOOD POSITION.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I do not think that a covert hack ought to exceed fifteen
hands in height. He should walk with ease and freedom,
trot ten miles an hour, and canter fifteen, without any
trouble, or blowing, or other symptoms of distress. Of
<a id="Page_207" href="#Page_207" class="pagenum" title="207"> </a>
course he cannot do this if his lungs are not as sound as
bells, and his legs and feet perfectly healthy. I may say,
however, that exhibitions of <em>pace</em> are perfectly unnecessary;
nobody really needs to gallop full tilt to covert—but light
easy action, and reliable powers of endurance, ought not to
be lightly esteemed. Beauty may be altogether dispensed
with in the covert hack—although it is generally so coveted
that buyers will often ignore many important defects on
account of it. I don’t approve of this. I have seen most
excellent hacks who had coarse heads, blemished bodies,
rat tails, and other undeniably ugly attributes—but what
mattered it, so long as they had perfections of a more
<a id="Page_208" href="#Page_208" class="pagenum" title="208"> </a>
important kind? Such animals are not wanted for show,
as are their more gaudy brethren the park hacks.</p>

<p>I like to see the ribs of all riding-horses long in front of
the girths, and short behind them. This keeps the saddle
in the proper place, which it is hard to do (without the aid
of the old-fashioned crupper) where the ribs in front are
short.</p>

<p>The race of genuine covert hacks is, I am sorry to say,
apparently fast dying out. Go, for instance, to any ordinary
meet of hounds in almost any hunting country—you will
see votaries of the chase arriving in every variety of
vehicle: in phaetons, dogcarts, waggonettes, on drags and
in broughams, on the backs of horses that they mean to
hunt, on “general utility” animals, on fine park hacks,
brought out to be admired and then cantered home again
along the roadside grasses, or hand-galloped through the
fields where convenient gates abound—but the number
of real covert hacks will be very small indeed. I suppose
the reason is, that in this troublous age, few (in Ireland at
all events) can afford to indulge in luxuries, and a good
hack <em>is</em> one, in the very fullest sense of the term.</p>

<p>I do not believe, although many do, that it spoils a
saddle horse to put him in harness. Were I rich enough to
possess a number of hunters, I should drive them in a four-horse
drag during the summer months, and I believe it
would do them an immensity of good. A covert hack of
the useful sort makes an excellent trapper, or one of a
pair in a brougham or waggonette—nor does he lose any
of his saddle qualities by being so made use of.</p>
<a id="Page_209" href="#Page_209" class="pagenum" title="209"> </a>

<p>I may here say that, for country or covert riding, I do
not at all approve of the ordinary half-bred cobs, which
so many sportsmen, and some sporting ladies also, are
prone to affect. No doubt they are strong: it is their only
recommendation; but even this very strength is in one
way an objection to them, for it is in many instances
derived from a close connection with cart-horse blood, and
on this account they very soon tire when trotting, and
begin to step short, which occasions them to trip, and very
often to come down. Besides, it is almost a matter of
course that their shoulders are straight, and their fore-feet
carried too far under them. In every way, therefore, I
object to these animals for saddle use—especially where
ladies are concerned.</p>

<p>Scarce as riding horses of endurance are in this country,
there is no doubt whatever that we have the breed, and
that it only requires careful cultivation—by which I mean
<em>select</em>—in distant Colonies, where our road and rail luxuries
are not, for love or money, to be obtained. In Southern
Africa and distant Australia this has been proved, as also
in the crosses of our horses with Continental ones, in Italy,
Germany, and Spain.</p>

<p>I now come to speak about hunters. In choosing these,
do not go in for outward beauty of form, for it will not
stand you in any stead. I am compelled to impress this
upon ladies—especially very young ones—because they
usually select their horses (as they do their husbands!) for
appearance more than for genuine worth. It is such a
perfectly natural weakness that nobody can be blamed for
<a id="Page_210" href="#Page_210" class="pagenum" title="210"> </a>
it. Everybody likes “something to look at,” but there is
more than this to be desired in many respects. I remember
either reading somewhere, or hearing somebody say, that a
hunter that combined high courage with so fine a temper
that he would stand while his owner opened gates or remounted
him after a fall—one that liked his trade, cried
“Ha, ha!” at the sound of the huntsman’s horn, went
generously at his fences as if he relished them, picked his
places sensibly, had a good constitution, drank his gruel
freely after the day’s work was over, would stand two
ordinary days a week, and three good ones along with
them in the course of a fortnight—was a treasure, even
though he might have an ugly head, a ridiculous tail, an
unfashionable colour, corns at times, and many skin-deep
blemishes. In addition to all this, I may add that if he is
a fairly good hack, and can trot or jog his ten or twelve
miles home to his stable after a hardish day, he is simply
an invaluable acquisition, especially to those who love sport,
yet have not the good fortune to possess a sporting income.</p>

<p>It is rarely, however, that one is lucky enough to meet
with so entirely desirable an animal, and <em>when</em> found he
certainly ought to be prized.</p>

<p>The essential points for a hunter are these: a good constitution,
so that he may bear hardships and hard knocks;
good powers of endurance, to enable him to stand long
and tiresome days, and frequently to travel lengthy distances
homewards; good shoulders, and strong healthy
legs and feet. Further good points are, a back powerful
enough to bear any weight that he is meant to carry; hind
<a id="Page_211" href="#Page_211" class="pagenum" title="211"> </a>
quarters with propelling powers to land him safely over
his fences; a good chest, with lungs inside of it sufficiently
sound to allow of his galloping without showing signs of
distress; and good eyes to enable him to see where he
is going.</p>

    <div class="caption"><p>VERY DEFECTIVE.</p></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Straight fore-legs, such as are shown in the illustration,
are an absolutely essential quality—and they should emerge
from the trunk with plenty of firm muscle as well as good
fleshy substance. Legs that are too close together, or too
far apart, are alike defective, and ought not to be overlooked.</p>

</div>

<p>A hunter for a lady’s use need not, as a rule, be over
fifteen hands in height, or about 15·2 for a man of ordinary
stature. Of course top-weights of either sex must have
something proportionately big to carry them, but my
experience is that clever hunters of 15·2 or 3 can negotiate
even the biggest country with safety, and I believe there
are a greater number of perfect fencers of that height than
can be found among those above it. Small horses, whether
hunters or steeplechasers, have distinguished themselves
brilliantly from time to time all over the world, yet the
rage for tall ones is very great. About ten years ago, at
the Islington Horse Show, there were forty hunters (out
of 100 entries) that were over 16 hands high, and they
<a id="Page_213" href="#Page_213" class="pagenum" title="213"> </a>
were among the very first sold, some of them to extremely
diminutive purchasers. I was speaking about this a year
or two ago to a dealer, and asking him his opinion respecting
the cause, when he made me laugh by answering,
“Well, you see, big horses makes big fences look a trifle
smaller, and that’s something to them as rides.”</p>

<p>I have always considered it a good plan to select a
hunter, with due regard to the country in which his purchaser
intends to hunt. For example, if hilly, or composed of
wide grass lands, or plough, good breeding will be decidedly
essential, because with it good staying powers will be combined;
if trappy, or difficult, requiring constant pulling up
at fences and careful getting over, extreme cleverness
will be far more valuable than blood. Even a broken-winded
horse will, if cautious and clever, be more useful
over such a country, than a flyer or very flippant jumper—because
he can catch his wind between his efforts, and will
not be likely to exhibit distress.</p>

<p>If you cannot count upon a horse’s pedigree, when
looking for a blood one, you can generally judge him by
his haunch. I think it an excellent test of breeding. A
well-bred haunch and handsomely carried tail, impart a
dignity of appearance which is unmistakable, and they are
certainly far in advance of the rounded quarter and drooping
caudal appendage which my sketch on the succeeding
page represent.</p>

<p>Still further commendable points in a hunter are <em>long</em>
shoulders, high withers, broad hips, and loose flanks: this
latter in order (as I have heard it expressed) that he may
<a id="Page_214" href="#Page_214" class="pagenum" title="214"> </a>
“dash” his haunches under him at the big jumps. He
should have good shoulder action, but it matters little (as
I have said) about that of the knees.</p>

</div>

<p>A hunter is thought to be in his prime at six years old, and
if this be the case, every hunter in the kingdom—especially
those with which dealers have anything to do—must be
just arrived at that happy meridian, for surely no one has
ever yet inquired the age of such an animal without being
told that he was “just six year old,” or “rising” it. I have
known some admirable hunters, however, who had passed
the familiar landmark by four years or upwards; and in the
west of Ireland I saw one, and rode him too, who was said
to be eighteen years old, and certainly a finer fencer it has
rarely been my lot to handle.</p>
<a id="Page_215" href="#Page_215" class="pagenum" title="215"> </a>

<p>I do not, however, as a rule, recommend young horsewomen
to purchase aged hunters. I have generally found
them to be too crafty and clever, calculating their distances
<em>too</em> finely, and leaving themselves nothing at all to spare.
Better mount a young rider on a young, generous goer,
who will give himself a couple of feet or more over the
mark.</p>

<p>Never judge of a hunter from seeing him jump in cold
blood, because many animals that will perform calmly and
collectedly over a schooling-ground, become so tremendously
excited in the hunting-field that they are altogether
beyond the powers of a lady to control. I need not say
that horses of this class are not only unpleasant, but are
highly dangerous mounts.</p>

<p>I always advise ladies who have invested in anything
that they find disappointing—either a rusher, refuser,
plunger, or anything else—to entrust him at once to
thoroughly competent hands to break him of the vice. I
believe largely in horse-dealing farmers of the straight-riding
sort. A horse given up to one of these will be
exercised about the lands through the summer months,
taught to get slowly through gaps and over difficult fences,
made to stand quietly to be mounted, and ridden temperately
but with determination when hounds begin to run.</p>

<p>A hunter that pulls should never be made use of by a
lady, but for my own riding I have always preferred an
animal that gave me something to do to hold him, to one
that stuck his head in the air and refused to take hold of
his bridle. I don’t know anything that renders a lady
<a id="Page_216" href="#Page_216" class="pagenum" title="216"> </a>
more helpless in a quick run than a horse that is too light-mouthed,
and that flings his head up every time he feels
the action of the bit. I would not take a present of such
a one for my own use.</p>

<p>It is an excellent plan for ladies to train their hunters to
follow them when on foot. Suppose that in the course of a
run you happen to come to some awfully cranky place:
cramped, difficult, and highly dangerous to ride, you may
find it pleasant and advisable to get off and scramble it,
and your steed will follow you beautifully if you have him
trained. It is quite easy to do it; accustom him to the
tone of your voice, and if in the country take him out on
summer evenings with a leading-rein and a pocketful of
carrots. You will not have much difficulty after a while,
and it is quite worth the trouble, even if you are disposed
to think it such, which I never did.</p>

<p>There used long ago to be certain counties celebrated for
good hunters. Ireland was, and is, <em>justly</em> famous, both for
breeding and training youngsters of a style fit for any
hunting-field: but posts, telegraphs, and telephones have
placed us far more on a level than we used to be, and I
don’t believe that there is now anything like the advantage
enjoyed by our fathers and grandfathers in purchasing
direct from a breeder.</p>

<p>I may wind up by saying that no horse is worthy of
being called a hunter that cannot be turned in a very
small circle, that jumps with his hind-legs stretched out
behind him, or that won’t at all events <em>attempt</em> any fence at
which his owner may wish to turn him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />

<span class="chapter-title">IN THE HUNTING-FIELD.</span></h2>


<p>A very tempting title truly, but before we can get there
we must say a word about the preparation for it, and also
about the journey to be taken to reach the desired goal.</p>

<p>To prepare, therefore, you should look first to your
horse; you must get him into good hard-fed condition
some time before the opening of the season, and either
exercise him regularly yourself, or get somebody to do
it for you. The subject of feeding I hope to discuss in a
forthcoming chapter—as also that of shoeing, which is
extremely important. I may here say, however, that my
system of feeding hunters is in many points so widely
different to that of others that I shall not undertake to
advocate it openly, but shall merely state that I have found
it answer most admirably in my own stable, and that many
private friends to whom I have recommended it have
endorsed my opinion of its excellence. The only portion
of it to which I shall in this chapter refer, is concerning
the <em>times</em> at which I think the meals ought to be
given. I advise that hunters be accustomed all the year
round to do without a heavy midday meal: this practice
to be adhered to during the summer months, as well as in
<a id="Page_218" href="#Page_218" class="pagenum" title="218"> </a>
winter; in fact, whether the animal is doing work or not.
A good substantial feed at 7 <span class="smaller">A.M.</span>, and another twelve
hours later, with one <em>of hay only</em> (but plenty of it, and of
the best) at noon, is all the food that need be given.
Horses fed thus do not, on even very long days, miss anything
except their midday repast, whereas, if accustomed
to a solid feed of corn in the middle of the day, the vacuum
created by the want of it must certainly tell upon the
animals, and render them in a great degree unfitted for
their tasks.</p>

<p>Let your horse, then, be fed as I have directed, and you
will (confidently speaking) find him quite able and ready
for the long days which are so trying to horses that are
not in condition, as well as to many that are.</p>

<p>Look to his shoeing a day or two before you want to
use him, and when I say “look,” I mean for you to do it
yourself, and not merely inquire of the servant whether it
has been done, unless, indeed, he is one of those treasures
who are as rarely to be met with as the proverbial four-leaved
shamrock, or the horse that is a day over six years
old. Grooms will not, as a rule, trouble themselves much
about the shoeing department, except at the most inconvenient
times; when they don’t want you to go out, for
instance, it is quite surprising how quickly they contrive to
discover that the horse must go to the forge. I know all
their little tricks perfectly well, and the length of time, too,
that they generally find it necessary to be absent when that
forge business is declared to be a necessity that cannot be
done without; therefore, it will be well to look to it <em>always</em>
<a id="Page_219" href="#Page_219" class="pagenum" title="219"> </a>
yourself, a good bit in advance, in order that you may not
in any wise be taken unprepared.</p>

<p>Give a glance over your hunting-gear also, lest anything
should be astray. It is not at the last moment that such
things ought ever to be looked to. See that your gloves
are in good order, and your riding-breeches perfectly whole—for,
remember, there is a great and constant strain on this
particular garment, and it will in consequence stand in
frequent need of repairs. Make certain also that your skirt
is neatly brushed, your hat in perfection, and your whip
and spur in perfect readiness for use.</p>

<p>Having made these preparations, you must turn your
thoughts from necessaries to possible contingencies, and
hold yourself in readiness for such. Procure a small, tidy
valise, and in it place a complete change of warm clothing.
You can dispense with fashionable and costly articles, and
put in merely such things as will prove convenient in the
possible event of your being either dyked, or subjected to
such a wetting from above as would render it unsafe for
you to proceed homewards in your riding-habit. Of course,
I am now surmising that you either drive or rail to the
hunt, and return the same way.</p>

<p>If you ride a hack to covert, or jog your hunter at
an easy pace, you will not only find it impossible to carry
a change of clothing, but you will not have any need
of such, because nobody ever catches cold, even from wet
clothes, so long as motion and circulation are kept up;
but if you have a long drive homewards after a hard and
exciting day, or a journey (even a short one) to perform by
<a id="Page_220" href="#Page_220" class="pagenum" title="220"> </a>
rail, I strongly advocate the carrying of the valise. It will
not prove a source of the least trouble to you. You can
leave it either in your vehicle or at the railway station, and
it is an inconceivable comfort to be able to get into a dry
suit when every stitch that you have on is clinging to your
body, heavy with wet and mud. I advise the labelling
of the valise in plain letters, if it is to be left in any
waiting-room. To attend to this may prevent a good deal
of possible confusion. Many ladies think it a trouble, I
know, to carry such things about with them—just as men,
when they go out walking, consider it “a nuisance” to
carry an umbrella or an overcoat, even on the most uncertain
and showery days—paying the penalty, of course,
in drenched garments, rheumatism, and catarrh. The
“trouble” in the first instance is very small; in the second
it may be serious.</p>

<p>Having then made all square and ready, we have next
to consider in what way you intend to proceed to covert.
If by rail or vehicle, and that you happen to have friends
of an obliging sort living close to the proposed meet, you
may perhaps find them willing to give accommodation to
your mount for the preceding night. If so it will be very
pleasant, both for you and your horse, as the animal will
be as fresh as a daisy to carry you—a cheery thing for
both parties. You must, however, remember that you will
be under a very decided compliment—one which many
may not desire to incur—to the friend who shows you
this favour, inasmuch as putting up a horse signifies either
putting up a servant also, or sending a groom to meet the
<a id="Page_221" href="#Page_221" class="pagenum" title="221"> </a>
animal at the station; at all events it entails extra stable
duties, and these must be considered and paid for.</p>

<p>Supposing that you do not send your horse anywhere
the night before, see to it that he gets off betimes in the
morning, and, if going by road, give your servant directions
to take him to some quiet corner or laneway close to the
meet, and to wait for you there until you come. I regard
this as a very much better plan than having him led <em>direct</em>
to the meet, and mounting him there in presence of an
assembled crowd. Ladies who like a little bit of show
generally prefer the latter way—but for true comfort, opportunity
for overlooking the general turning-out of your horse,
lengthening or shortening of stirrup-leathers, folding your
muffling tidily away (instead of flinging it anywhere or anyhow
into the vehicle), giving your groom directions where
to meet you at the close of the day, and so forth, commend
me to the former.</p>

<p>If a hunter is to be railed, let him go to the station well
clothed, and send extra things along with him for coming
home. Winter evenings are usually chilly, if not downright
cold, and are very frequently damp as well; if, then,
a heated animal, with every pore open from exercise and
excitement, is called upon, unprepared, to encounter these
combined atmospheric influences, coughs, catarrhs, rheumatic
affections, and sometimes the more serious evils of
inflamed or congested lungs, are certain to be the results.</p>

<p>Rise early yourself on a hunting morning; have a cold
bath, if of a robust temperament—if not, tepid. Eat a
moderate breakfast of white fish, cutlet, or steak, accompanied
<a id="Page_222" href="#Page_222" class="pagenum" title="222"> </a>
by dry toast or biscuit, and partake of very little
liquid. Fill your flask with cold tea: it is more invigorating
than either brandy or wine; and provide a small
sandwich, or a biscuit or two, to put in the pocket of
your saddle. This will be provision enough for the commissariat
department.</p>

<p>If you have the luxury of riding a good hack to covert,
and that the distance is not very far—say, from five to
eight miles—you will be certain to enjoy it, and it will
put you in fettle for the more serious business of the
day. This again, like the bath, means if you are strong
and hardy: in short, inured to long rides, and not by any
means easily fatigued. If it be not so with you, it will be
better to make arrangements to go by rail, or drive.</p>

<p>Some ladies ride their hunters quite long distances to
meets, but as a rule they are not among the straight-going
sort, being satisfied with seeing the first draw and the
burst away over a good line of country, where the two or
three preliminary fences are not such as to occasion many
serious mishaps. I do not think that any lady who rides
even moderately straight ought to hack her hunter for a
longer distance than five or six miles of a good fair road,
and the best way to take him will be at a brisk walk,
alternated pretty frequently with a steady jog-trot, or a hand-gallop
on the grass at the side. I do not at all object to a
hunter being allowed to drink a little water before starting
on his journey, although I know that very many disagree
with me on the point; nor do I object to his having a few
mouthfuls in the intervals of hunting; it will refresh
<a id="Page_223" href="#Page_223" class="pagenum" title="223"> </a>
him excessively, just as a small goblet of water would
refresh <em>you</em>, although a large one might overload your
stomach, or give you a chill.</p>

<p>On arriving at the meet, keep as quiet and as much in
the background as you possibly can. It is better taste by
far than to push forward in ever so small a degree. Do
not trouble yourself with thinking about your own appearance,
be it what it may; in all probability nobody will be
minding you at all. If you are perfectly well turned-out,
feel happy in the consciousness that you are so, but <em>shun
display</em>; if indifferently, console yourself with the reflection
that each man and woman present is occupied in admiring
him or herself, and has neither time nor desire to admire
you, or the reverse.</p>

<p>Do not expect that august personage, “the master,” to
shake hands with you, even if acquainted, or to stop and
talk. Salute him as he goes by, but nothing further.</p>

<p>Do not worry the huntsman with questions about the
proposed draws, or anything else. If you know him, salute
him, and say a word or two, if you like, about his hounds,
but never expect him to answer you; his mind is on other
matters bent.</p>

<p>Do not indulge in loud talking, or conspicuous laughter,
which will be certain to render you remarkable and bring
many eyes upon you. A quiet, ladylike demeanour will
always ensure admirers.</p>

<p>When the order is given to go, and the huntsman moves
off in front with his hounds, contrive to keep as close to
him as you can, without an appearance of “push.” This
<a id="Page_224" href="#Page_224" class="pagenum" title="224"> </a>
for the obvious reason that a fox is very often found the
moment (or nearly so) that hounds are thrown into covert,
and if you are on the spot, you may get well away with
the pack; whereas, at the end of a long cavalcade, on a
narrow and difficult roadway, it will be ten to one against
your doing anything better than hunting a stern chase for
the remainder of the run.</p>

<p>It has for long been a vexed question whether or not
the hunting-field is a suitable place for ladies, and I am
certainly not going to discuss it <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in extenso</i>, especially in a
necessarily limited space. One or two things concerning
it I may, however, be permitted to say.</p>

<p>Firstly, that timid ladies, those mounted on badly broken
horses, and others (a large community) who push for first
place while in reality only fitted to take third (in company
with wheezy old gentlemen on fat cobs, farmers on green
colts, and the numerous company of confessed road-riders),
are a very <em>decided nuisance</em> in the field; and, secondly,
that ladies who possess courage (by which I do not mean
the effrontery of ignorance and vanity combined), who are
thoroughly well mounted, and who never get in anybody’s
way, are, in my opinion, a charming addition to the
delightful pleasures of the chase. If, then, you want to
be considered an acquisition, be contented—especially if a
beginner—to take second place: that is, not to force a way
among the hard-riding lot, or expose yourself to the
numerous perils which really first-flight men and women
go out prepared to encounter—ay, and usually manage
to get through safely, too, if not interfered with or
<a id="Page_225" href="#Page_225" class="pagenum" title="225"> </a>
endangered by second and third-class riders. By-and-by,
when you have gained the knowledge and experience
which getting up from the ranks will assuredly bring you,
there will be an extra pleasure in finding yourself not
only holding first place in the most difficult runs, but in
knowing that you are <em>qualified</em> to hold it, and are justified
in declining to yield it up to others who may not have won
their spurs.</p>

<p>If, however, you desire to render yourself thoroughly obnoxious
to everybody, you can set about it in this way.
Select for your mount something that is both fidgetty and
showy, yet utterly “incapable.” Whenever you attempt a
fence keep your horse at it, whether you have any chance
of getting over or not, to the exclusion of half the field.
When you get on fair ground, gallop madly forward and
override the hounds, if you chance by a “fluke” to get
near enough to them to do so. When there is a check,
and the pack fails in hitting off the scent at once, slash at
the nearest of them with your hunting-whip, and tell the
animal playfully that it is “a naughty dog not to hunt
better.” Always make a point of crowding at gaps and
gateways, when hounds and field are struggling to get
through. Never fail to effect an intimate acquaintance
with the master, and be sure to call the huntsman, when
speaking of him, “Bill Simmonds” or “Jim Brown,” although
“Simmonds” or “Brown” may be quite enough for
other people. Always follow this last-mentioned functionary
into covert, and speak to him all the time that he is
anxiously watching his hounds. Should you happen to
<a id="Page_226" href="#Page_226" class="pagenum" title="226"> </a>
view the fox away, swell out your lungs for a good bellow
of <i>Tally ho-oooo!</i> and gallop full tilt at him before ever a
single hound has left covert, which wise proceeding will be
certain to turn him back, and gain for you the blessings of
all genuine lovers of sport. Finally, when the game at
length breaks fair, rush away in advance of everybody else,
with your chin to the sky, and your elbows flapping like the
sails of a windmill; and when you have half-killed your
ill-conditioned steed, and frightened the wits out of a score
or two of old squires who have long ago lost their nerves
(together with their appreciation of such “hard riding” as
yours), then pull off, and dose everybody with whom you are
acquainted, for the next week or two, with glowing accounts
of the wonders that you performed on the opening day with
the Dashshire hounds, and the merits, beauties, and achievments
of the exquisite animal that carried you so brilliantly
through the first run of the season. By adopting this
mode of proceeding you will be certain to gain a host of
admirers in the field, and will do much toward disabusing
the public mind of the idea (very deeply implanted in it)
that the hunting-field is not a place in which ladies ought
to seek for sport.</p>

<p>Now, in conclusion, allow me in all seriousness to lay
down a few maxims for your instruction. Never go to
hunt without a good pilot. Young lovers are very nice
for this purpose, although not always the safest. I recommend
sharp <em>old</em> foxhunters, who know the country,
and who will give you a judicious lead. If you cannot
secure a trustworthy leader, dispense altogether with the
<a id="Page_227" href="#Page_227" class="pagenum" title="227"> </a>
services of one, and cut out a line for yourself, <em>provided</em>
that you are mounted on a really first-class animal, one well
up to your weight, and endowed with an infallible knowledge
of where to put his feet. Keep the hounds in sight
if you can, or, at any rate, within hearing, and ride rather
wide of them, to right or left; never in their actual wake.
Keep your horse well in hand all through, that he may not
sprawl. Be quick at turning. Avoid, so far as is possible,
deep heavy lands; and if traversing plough, keep along
the headlands rather than pump your steed by galloping
over ridge and furrow, as others frequently do. When
obliged to get through gaps and gates put extra steam on
when coming up to them, in order to be first; and if there
is a crowd, hold your horse hard, and touch him lightly
with your spur, that he may keep up his mettle and be
ready to bound into full speed the instant you get clear
of the ruck. If riding a young hot-blooded hunter, it will
as a rule be safer for you to put him at a very big jump
than to trust him in a crowded gangway. While riding
hard, never so much as glance at the remainder of the field.
Keep your eyes for your horse and for the <em>leading</em> hounds,
so as to keep exactly with them, and check <em>the very
instant</em> that they do.</p>

<p>Never distress your mount by taking unnecessary jumps.
Don’t be a bit ashamed to make use of a convenient gate
if you can get along with equal quickness that way; it will
save your horse, and will enable you to hold your place
much longer in the run; but, at the same time, never shirk
a practicable jump when you want to go straight.</p>
<a id="Page_228" href="#Page_228" class="pagenum" title="228"> </a>

<p>If riding a kicker, give warning to those in the rear of
you to keep out of the way. Never jump over a fallen
horseman; select another part of the fence to effect your
leap. Do not continue to ride a beaten animal; pull off
the moment that he hangs out signals of distress. When
called upon to cross a ford, do so very cautiously, and if
your horse makes a kind of <em>forward plunge</em>, and an attempt
at swimming, throw him the reins at once or he will roll
over. Do not on any account interfere with his mouth at
such a time. Keep your left foot stuck well forward, or,
better still, lift the leg right over the leaping-head, that it
may not be struck by the horse’s hind foot—and at the
same time take a firm grip of the up-pommel and the off-side
of the saddle, to avoid being unseated when he makes
his second plunge, which he will do the moment that he
recovers his footing.</p>

<p>If the first run of the day be a good one, rest satisfied
with it, and do not attempt another, unless you have a
second horse out. If your mount should chance to lose a
shoe, especially a fore one, make at once for the nearest
forge. If one of the hind feet has sustained the loss, you
may continue the run, provided the going is over soft
ground—but when a fore shoe happens to go, pull off without
a moment’s delay. I have always thought it an admirable
plan to <em>carry</em> a shoe, or slipper, slung on (in its neat leather
case) cavalry-wise, to the saddle. This, in case of accident,
obviates the necessity of waiting at the forge while the
smith manufactures one—and of course on arrival at
home it can readily be changed for a more durable foot-protector.
<a id="Page_229" href="#Page_229" class="pagenum" title="229"> </a>
I have even known some sage old sportsmen
carry in their pockets a little American hammer and nail-box
in one, and do their own shoeing when they found
themselves in difficulties and at a distance from professional
aid.</p>

<p>Dismount when there is a check, if only for an instant;
and, when there is time, shift your saddle an inch back
or forward, the first for preference. This will prove a great
refreshment to your mount.</p>

<p>Be uniformly kind and courteous to everybody. If you
chance to distinguish yourself by good riding, or good
fortune, make no fuss about it, or look for adulation.
Always carry a yard or two of twine, a pick, and a few
shillings along with you; there may be uses for all.</p>

<p>When riding home, if you <em>do</em> ride, grasp the first
opportunity of getting your horse some warm gruel, and
take him through a shallow ford or pond to wash the
mud from his legs and belly. When you get him to his
stable do not allow him to be tormented by elaborate
grooming; see that he is given an abundance of straw to
roll in, and a good bucket of linseed tea to drink; have
his ears dried by pulling them, bandage his legs with
flannel, and give him an abundance of <em>fresh air</em>, which is of
far more consequence to an exhausted hunter than either
food or water. I greatly disapprove of admitting draughts,
especially thorough ones—but it is a dire mistake to
cram a horse into a close stable, with every chink stopped
up, and then put a huge quantity of hay and oats before
him. Bad air and improper feeding soon do their work.
<a id="Page_230" href="#Page_230" class="pagenum" title="230"> </a>
Some valuable animal is taken ill, a farrier is sent for, he
tries bleeding to stop the terrific action of the heart, and
before morning the horse is dead.</p>

<p>I shall have something useful to say on this and kindred
subjects in my chapter on “Doctoring,” later on.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />

<span class="chapter-title">SHOEING.</span></h2>


<p>There are three points concerning this important subject
on which I should like to thoroughly convince my readers.
Firstly, that the theory, sometimes put forward, of dispensing
with shoes for horses that are intended to work in
paved cities and over rough roads, is a fallacious one;
secondly, that the shoeing done at ordinary forges is practically
all wrong; and, thirdly, that there is nothing at all
derogatory in going down one’s-self to the blacksmith’s, in
company with the animal to be shod, and not only giving
directions about the way in which it will be most advisable
to do it, but standing by to make certain that it is actually
done. Common errors among smiths are these; cutting
down the frog until it cannot possibly come in contact with
the ground; paring the sole, until it is either bedewed with
blood, or so thin that the effort to walk on it causes the
horse to wince; opening the “bars” which join the frog to
the outer wall of the foot; putting on unnecessarily heavy
shoes; having a strong predilection in favour of calkins;
rasping down the wall of the foot to fit the shoe, instead of
making the shoe to fit the foot; and removing too much
of the heel horn. These faults proceed, as a rule, more
<a id="Page_232" href="#Page_232" class="pagenum" title="232"> </a>
from ignorance than obstinacy, and it would therefore be a
good and wise thing if every farrier were to be made
thoroughly acquainted with the anatomy of the horse’s foot
and leg: he would then perceive what dire mischief he was
in reality doing while pursuing the ordinary stereotyped
course which his father and grandfather probably followed
before him.</p>

<p>To look at this list of errors in review. First of all, the
frog should never be interfered with; to pare it with a
knife is ruinous; it <em>ought</em> to touch the ground instead of
being prevented from doing so: nature intended that it
should. It retains the hoof in proper shape at the heels,
prevents the tendency to slip, and in fact acts as the
natural buffer of the foot, giving it strength, security, and
elasticity, while its toughness enables it to travel over the
roughest country without shrinking or pain. It wards off
concussion, being surrounded by lateral cartilages which
may be described as yielding sidewalls, and is the contrivance
supplied by nature for preserving the superimposed
structures from injury or passing hurt. Cutting into the
frog is, I am most firmly convinced, one of the chief causes
of thrush, and nothing can more clearly prove this than the
fact that diseased and wasted frogs, and thrushes of long
and obstinate standing, have been known to become completely
cured by the adoption of a proper system of shoeing—one
that brought the frog not only near the ground,
but actually on it.</p>

<p>Navicular disease, that terror of every horse-owner, is
without doubt largely induced by improper shoeing, coupled
<a id="Page_233" href="#Page_233" class="pagenum" title="233"> </a>
with the pernicious practice which I am now condemning,
of cutting away the frog. This valuable india-rubber-like
substance should be jealously guarded, and most carefully
preserved from injury or waste; a knife ought no more
be allowed to touch it than permitted to penetrate the
horse’s eye; perhaps even with greater care ought it to
be preserved, for whereas some excellent goers have but
one eye to see with, an animal on three legs is of but little
use to anybody, except the knacker, into whose hands he is
pretty certain soon to fall.</p>

<p>Second on the list of evils comes the paring away of the
sole of the foot, and so general is this most unwise operation,
that grooms absolutely prepare for it the night before their
charges go to the forge, by stopping their feet with cow-dung,
or some other horrible dirt. The practice is a cruel,
useless, and highly deleterious one, which owners of horses
ought not in anywise to encourage or permit.</p>

<p>Third, is the hideous habit of opening up the heels:
which means making a deep incision into the wall of the
foot <em>at</em> the heel, just where it is bent inward to form the
bars. Nothing could possibly be more injurious or injudicious
than this detestable operation. It weakens the
wall of the foot, and occasions what all horse-fanciers strive
to guard against, the evil of contracted heels. The frog,
sole, and bars have each a separate and most important
duty to perform, and are, if unwisely interfered with, rendered
absolutely incapable of contributing to the carrying
out of Nature’s exemplary plan.</p>

<p>Fourth, is the custom of putting on shoes that are too
<a id="Page_234" href="#Page_234" class="pagenum" title="234"> </a>
clumsy, weighty, and thick. A thin, light shoe is in every
respect preferable, the lightness of the metal ensuring a firm
foothold, while it likewise brings the foot-proper in closer
proximity to the ground.</p>

<p>Fifth, is the strong fancy for calkins,—things which I as
strongly decry, except for heavy draught horses, and for
those accustomed to trust to their assistance for backing
weighty loads. Even where such appendages are acknowledged
to be necessary, a toe-piece should be likewise
added to the shoe and the forepart slightly thickened, in
order to ensure an evenness and steadiness of footing,
together with the keeping of the foot in its own natural
position. A horse mounted upon calkins without the
addition of the toe-piece must feel quite as uncomfortable
as a vain belle when mounted upon a pair of tapering high
heels.</p>

<p>Another way of preventing injury in the form of contractions
from calkins is, to have the shoes forged of even thickness
from heel to toe, and then to remove a portion of metal
from underneath the quarters. A horse’s real weight is on
his toes and heels: nature shows this by weakening the
hoofs at the quarters, and the law of mechanics illustrates
that if the extremities of any powerful substance are equally
and adequately sustained, the absolute <em>body</em> which forms as
it were a bridge over the space, may be trusted without
support.</p>

<p>Sixth, is a terrible evil: namely, employing the rasp to
the outer wall of the foot, in order to bring it down to the
size of a shoe that is too small for it. This cruelty is
<a id="Page_235" href="#Page_235" class="pagenum" title="235"> </a>
generally perpetrated by farriers who consider themselves
too hurried, but are in reality too lazy, to undertake the
forging of a properly fitting shoe, and so they lay hands on
one that happens to be lying by them, and having affixed it,
proceed to cut down the foot to its level. The wretchedness
of the animal, when set to walk upon this torturing
protector, is precisely like that which we should suffer were
our feet to be crushed into boots or shoes that were ever
so many sizes too small for them. By this cruel practice
the horn of the foot is seriously injured, and months elapse
before it resumes its normal shape and condition.</p>

    <div class="caption"><p>SHOE MADE TO FIT FOOT.</p></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Removing too much of the heel-horn is the seventh evil
with which we have to deal. This is a very usual practice,
and is strongly calculated to make a temporary cripple of
the horse so operated upon. It ought to be remembered
that the ground face of the hoof should be even, and justly
proportioned from toe to heel, and that the sides of it ought
<a id="Page_236" href="#Page_236" class="pagenum" title="236"> </a>
to be of equal depth. There is at times, indeed very often,
an excess of horny growth about the toe, but it is impossible
to lay down any precise rule with reference to the angle to
which the hoof ought to be brought: a competent eye will,
however, judge of it, and will be able to decide whether it
is in conformity with the natural formation and bearing of
the limb.</p>

    <div class="caption"><p>HIGH HEEL.</p></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>I have a great fancy for tips—otherwise half-shoes, nailed
to the toes only, and leaving both quarters free. I have
known one or two young horses shod in this way who have
travelled quite safely, and shown wonderfully healthy feet.
For racers I particularly approve of them, and for young
light-weight hunters, especially when running in a grass
country. I am aware that there is a prejudice against them,
except for animals that are for awhile thrown up, but
it is an entirely ignorant one, and ought to be discarded.
The late Duke of Wellington was especially fond of tips,
and for a long while rode his horses with no other kind
<a id="Page_237" href="#Page_237" class="pagenum" title="237"> </a>
of foot-covering. He was at length, however, induced to
give it up, as he suffered torment from persons perpetually
informing him that his hack had cast a shoe. I
have from time to time been shown an immense variety of
<em>india-rubber</em> shoes, together with other novel kinds too
numerous to mention, and to all of them have found some
grave faults. Lyons has, however, lately produced a new
specimen, which has been experimented with upon French
horses in a manner somewhat successful. It is made
entirely of sheep’s horn, and is said to be particularly
adapted to such animals as are known not to be steady-footed
when going over pavements. It is, moreover,
excessively light and very durable—two excellent qualities—and
although at present somewhat more expensive than
the ordinary shoe, it will no doubt come down in price
when the novelty wears off, and will in all probability
replace the present style before the world is many years
older. For horses employed in towns it must be peculiarly
valuable, as it is said to be an effectual check against
slipping.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

  <div class="caption"><p>FOOT WITH TIP.</p></div>
</div>
<a id="Page_238" href="#Page_238" class="pagenum" title="238"> </a>

<p>Before closing the present chapter, I should like to warn
horse-owners still further against the ordinary uses of the
smith’s drawing-knife, rasp, and heated iron, all of which
are, as I have said, most lamentably abused. By the first,
especially, numerous “accidents” are made to occur. The
sole of the foot being all pared away and exposed close
to the earth, induces it to assume a harshness of texture
totally opposed to its natural qualities, which are soft and
yielding—and this change of structure is a fruitful source
of corns. The outer portion of the sole rests upon the
web of the shoe; the coffin-bone descends, and not meeting
with any yielding substance to play upon, the flesh is
pressed between the inferior surface of the bone and the
upper surface of the shoe, causing malignant corns.</p>

<p>Again, the <em>educated</em> smith, in order to give what he
terms “a better hold,” drives the fastening nails into the
black or outer substance of the wall of the foot; whereas
the untutored Arab preserves his horses’ feet by permitting
the walls to descend about half-an-inch below the sole, and
then driving the nails through this portion of the hoof. By
so doing, he averts the evil consequences of inserting iron
into the brittle substance, and secures at the same time
the resistance and tough qualities of the complex covering
of the foot. While the English smith is labouring to give
a tight hold, he is in reality involving three distinct perils—firstly,
pricking the sensitive foot, should the nail chance
to turn a little bit on one side—a thing which very often
happens; secondly, driving a nail too fine, or, in other
words, too near the white horn—the consequence of which
<a id="Page_239" href="#Page_239" class="pagenum" title="239"> </a>
is that it, the nail, turns <em>inward</em> when the horse is worked,
causing lameness to ensue; and, thirdly, to avoid these
evils, he points his nails so far outward that the outer
crust cracks, splits, and chips away, in time occasioning a
difficulty about finding any place at all capable of affording
holding properties for the necessary nails.</p>

<div class="side-by-side">
  <div class="figcenter w350">

    <div class="caption"><p>SHOE HANGING PENDULOUS.</p></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>It is owing to this evil that riders are so frequently inconvenienced
by their horses’ shoes becoming partially detached
from their feet. The weakest portion of the chipped hoof
yields first, the remaining fastenings follow, the shoe wags,
the nails lose their hold—with, perhaps, the exception of
one or two,—when the foot is raised its covering hangs
pendulous from it, and when again put down some nail still
remaining in the shoe pierces the plantar surface of the
foot, or, perhaps, even penetrates the coffin-bone, and
prolonged lameness follows. “This may be, and no doubt
is, all very true,” I fancy I can hear some reader say;
“but what on earth am I to do? I cannot shoe my
<a id="Page_240" href="#Page_240" class="pagenum" title="240"> </a>
horses myself, and smiths are so intolerably conceited.”
Just so; they certainly are, and I can entirely sympathise
with you; horse-owners are <em>terribly</em> dependent upon them,
ladies in particular. But I should advise you to do what
I myself have found effectual, namely, take your horses
either to a thoroughly <em>competent</em> farrier (there are, happily,
such to be found), or, what I think better still, to a
complete duffer!—one who knows very little about his
trade, and who, being aware of his deficiencies, will be
humble enough to accept your directions, and also willing
to act upon them and thankful for being afforded an
opportunity of doing so. I have heard that railway
companies seek for fools to act as pointsmen; by all
means, then, look out for an idiotic smith!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />

<span class="chapter-title">FEEDING.</span></h2>


<p>As already stated, I give my own ideas and opinions on
this subject, without any desire to thrust them forward, or
the least expectation of seeing them generally adopted.
Old prejudices are hard to get rid of; grooms are self-willed,
obstinate, and ignorant to a degree, and masters are
too yielding, or too indolent to interfere. I therefore
regard it as probable that on many persons the advice
contained in this chapter will be thrown away, while on
others—those who are willing to break new ground—it
will, I venture to say, have the salutary effect of producing
improvements in the stable, and increasing the weight of
the purse. By good management, which is the true secret
of all economy, a man, or woman, may keep a pair of horses
for the same yearly outlay that his or her less provident
neighbour will expend on keeping one—while the credit of
the stable will be quite as well, if not better, maintained.</p>

<p>I am most strongly in favour of cooked food, and
opposed to the giving of raw oats in any shape or form.
The absurd theory that this system of feeding is calculated
to make horses “soft,” is about as sensible as that which
avers (or would do so) that a man fed upon cooked rice and
<a id="Page_242" href="#Page_242" class="pagenum" title="242"> </a>
well-boiled potatoes, would be less capable of doing a good
day’s work than if compelled to eat the same materials
raw. Animals possessed of even the very best digestions
lose a great portion of the nutriment of their food when
given in the ordinary way—a large quantity of the oats
passing through their bodies quite as whole and unbroken
as when swallowed; whereas every grain of the cooked
food is assimilated with the blood, and goes to nourish the
system,—consequently, nothing is lost.</p>

<p>A chief reason for the prejudice against cooked food is
that it gives trouble, and is a “bother” to prepare. This
is always the groom’s excuse; everything is a trouble to
him, except thrusting a measure of hard dry corn, accompanied
by a bucket of water, at stated intervals before his
charge, and receiving his wages—at stated intervals also—for
so doing. Were he to understand, when being hired,
that to cook the food would form as much a portion of his
business as to groom and bed the horses, there would
probably be very little grumbling—especially when every
convenient appliance would be found ready to his hand;
but the difficulty always lies with the old and knowing
ones—men who have been accustomed all their lives to do
things their own way, and have things just as they pleased.
These, as a rule, resent every innovation, and are only to
be dealt with by persons as knowing and determined
as themselves.</p>

<p>Another source of objection is the idea that it will
require some special apparatus—some costly, difficult, complicated
contrivance for carrying out the proposed plan.
<a id="Page_243" href="#Page_243" class="pagenum" title="243"> </a>
There never was a greater mistake made. In my next
chapter, which will be entirely devoted to the subject of
stabling, I shall endeavour to show that the only apparatus
necessary is an exceedingly simple one,—certainly not by
any means of either a costly or extravagant nature.</p>

<p>To feed a horse four times a day, on any kind of food,
is in my opinion unnecessary; unless, indeed, he be an
extremely delicate feeder, in which case “little and often”
should be the rule; but I maintain that if fed but thrice
he ought to be given as good a proportion as is <em>ordinarily</em>
divided into four. I like to see a hard-working horse
able to eat his five quarterns of mixed oats and beans,
varied with a good mash once or twice a week, and always on
a Saturday night. At the same time I am entirely against
placing an excess of food in the manger at one time; it
is much better to give an animal just what he will finish,
than that he should not leave his manger perfectly clean.</p>

<p>Corn ought to be boiled until every grain is swollen to
nearly double its normal size, and is capable of being bruised
between the fingers; it should then be turned out on big trays
and left to cool. To suffer it to grow quite cold is not only
unnecessary, but is scarcely even advisable; tepid food is
much easier of digestion, both in the human stomach and in
that of the horse, than food that has become chilled. Cold
substances when swallowed, must rise to a temperature
of nearly 100° before the process of digestion can go
healthily forward, and that the food should be a step or
two on the road to this degree of warmth will materially
assist the sanitary laws of animal nature. There is not, at
<a id="Page_244" href="#Page_244" class="pagenum" title="244"> </a>
the same time, the very smallest necessity for administering
warm food at all periods when nourishment is given; on the
contrary, a change of diet will be found very beneficial, and
summer feeding ought to differ from that of winter, both in
quantity and temperature. In saying this, however, I do
not for a moment mean to convey that hunters, even when
not in use, should ever be allowed to drop out of condition.
I don’t believe they should, unless completely invalided and
not likely to be able to do any work during the ensuing
season. I think they ought to be fed with a proportion of
oats, though somewhat less than in winter time, and be
kept in <em>regular</em> exercise every day. I have already said
that I approve of driving hunters in harness during the
off season, and having seen it tested, I can speak for the
efficacy of it.</p>

<p>I have often been asked whether a horse ought to be
given the same quantity of boiled food as of unboiled; in
other words, if the process of cooking occasions the food
to swell to twice its natural size, and so to fill, say, two
measures in place of one, ought the two measures to be
given to the horse? My answer is, certainly, if the animal is
a voracious feeder, and is able to make a complete clearance
of all that is in his manger, even after getting the two
measures,—but I do not believe that one horse out of a
hundred will be capable of doing so, or will show the least
inclination to make use of so large a bulk of food. My
experience has been, that about three-fourths of the quantity
of cooked food is all that a horse will or can possibly
eat, and even this amount is unusual—a trifle more than
<a id="Page_245" href="#Page_245" class="pagenum" title="245"> </a>
half being the customary thing with horses who would
otherwise get through the full quantity of raw material,—and
herein lies the saving, for the satisfying bulk of the
food taken at a meal is largely increased by cooking, while
every particle of it goes to the nourishment of the animal’s
frame: a thing which is certainly not the case when the
substance is partaken of in its raw state.</p>

<p>The water in which corn has been boiled ought never by
any means to be thrown away; it sometimes is, by careless
or ignorant grooms, but the pity and wastefulness are very
great, for it is most admirable and nourishing for drinking
purposes, as well as for other stable uses.</p>

<p>To secure the purchase of good oats, buy them by
measurement, and not by weight. An excellent<!--TN: was 'excellant'--> sample
will weigh from 30 to 36 pounds to the bushel—a prime
one ought to weigh from 45 to 48—and this, be it observed,
will, when denuded of the chaff, yield scarcely more than
35 of pure grain. It is great nonsense to talk about the
advisability of purchasing black, golden, or white oats; all
three may be very good or very bad of their kind, and it is
in reality only the chaff that is coloured, the kernel of each
being of one tint. Sound oats ought to be dry, and very
hard; they should <em>chip</em> asunder when crushed—not have
anything of a torn appearance—and should be perfectly
scentless. The less bearded they are the better. I strongly
object to kiln-dried oats for horses, although many sellers
resort to the practice by way of expelling moisture from
new grain. I conceive it to be a thoroughly unwholesome
process, taking into account the fact that sulphur is frequently
<a id="Page_246" href="#Page_246" class="pagenum" title="246"> </a>
employed in it—a thing calculated to produce the
most terrible belly-ache, spasms, and gripes. If the presence
of sulphur is suspected, a sample of the oats may
be rubbed hastily between the palms of the hands, and the
peculiar odour will at once betray itself.</p>

<p>Beans are not much employed in Ireland as horse-food,
but in England they are very generally used. Egyptian
beans are the best; they are usually mild, sweet, and
tender. Peas are excellent—so are potatoes—and tares
possess so many virtues that it is a wonder the use of them
is so generally confined to farm teams. Carrots are very
good when not given too freely. I approve of them highly
for aged horses, but should be cautious about dealing them
out too profusely to young blood ones. I like to see them
given whole, or chopped so fine that the horse cannot run
the risk of choking himself by swallowing them in lumps.
This applies to almost all species of roots when given raw.
For delicate feeders carrots are especially valuable; they
give a peculiar relish to bran and other substances, and
cause such to be eagerly taken, even when rejected before.</p>

<p>Now a word about hay. Upland hay is the best. It
may be known by the following marks: a perfectly <em>clean</em>
look, a bright colour, a distinctness of fibre, an absence of
dust, a pleasant fresh smell, a decided crispness, a scarcity
of weeds, and the presence of seeds in the stems. Delicacy
and cleanliness are its characteristics, and it is in every
way immeasurably superior to lowland hay, which is tawny,
limp, strong smelling, and “woolly” to the touch.</p>

<p>New hay of any kind is objectionable for feeding
<a id="Page_247" href="#Page_247" class="pagenum" title="247"> </a>
purposes, but I consider that the year’s growth is quite fit
and wholesome in November.</p>

<p>Clover hay—that is, first-crop clover—is excellent for
mixing with upland; it is largely interspersed with grass,
the stems are fine, and the leaves untinged by blackness,
the flowers, though dried and faded, are abundant throughout
it, and retain much of their original colour. Second-crop
clover is not nearly so desirable; it may be known by
a coarse, strong flavour when put in the mouth, by the big
stems, the dingy appearance, and the noticeable blackness
of the leaves.</p>

<p>I do not approve of giving too much hay of any kind to
horses; a superabundance is apt to make them pot-bellied,
and unfit for hard work. Hunters, however, that get nothing
else for their mid-day meal, ought, when in the stable, to
be fed with sufficient quantity to make up for the absence
of more substantial food.</p>

<p>Ready-cut chaff ought never to be purchased; all sorts of
things find their way into it, just as is said to be the case
with cheap sausages!</p>

<p>Boiled barley is excellent food for horses. I have seen
some splendid youngsters that were fed on nothing else,
save the trifling addition of a very small portion of upland
hay.</p>

<p>Gruel, if given, should be as carefully prepared as though
made for the human subject; the neglect of this caution is
the cause of so many grooms thrusting heavy feeds before
exhausted horses, and averring that the animals “will not
drink gruel.” No wonder that they reject it, when the
<a id="Page_248" href="#Page_248" class="pagenum" title="248"> </a>
stuff so-named is merely a bucketful of hot water with a
handful or two of oatmeal stirred into it. My experience
of horses has not been a small one, and I can candidly say
that I have never yet seen even the most wearied or
delicate animal reject a properly prepared mess of gruel.</p>

<p>To make a good mash, allow at least a quartern of oats
and a pint of linseed—these to be boiled for three hours or
upwards, and then mixed with as much bran as will make
it of a proper damp consistency, but not a wet slop, or yet
a dry poultice. It should be given rather warm, and a little
salt is an excellent addition. A delicate or ailing animal
that will not eat his mash may often be tempted by putting
a little treacle or sugar into it.</p>

<p>A horse’s supply of water ought never to be limited. On
this I shall touch in my next chapter, in conjunction with
stable appliances and drinking-troughs. To drink plentifully
is a symptom of good health. Very cold water is not
advisable for horses; a handful of hay will take the chill
off, or a little meal thrown in. Nitre should never <em>under
any</em> pretext be added to the drink. Soft water is the best
for stable uses; if this cannot be conveniently procured,
hard water may be considerably softened by boiling, with
the addition of about half an ounce of carbonate of soda
to every pailful of liquid.</p>

<p>I strongly advocate <em>variety</em> of feeding for horses. My
own hunters were trained to eat and relish almost everything—except,
perhaps, codfish, on which the Newfoundlanders
bring up their horses wonderfully well! Mine
were given turnips, peas, potatoes (both boiled and raw),
<a id="Page_249" href="#Page_249" class="pagenum" title="249"> </a>
apples, pears, parsnips, patent horse biscuits, great armfuls of
cowslips and fresh soil, bread, and oatcake—in short, more
things than I can possibly enumerate. They were great pets,
and I loved to take little dainties out to them—a few nice ripe
plums, with the stones removed, a handful of sugar, a crisp
biscuit or two, or a juicy apple or pear. Such joy, such
whinnying, such turning of beautiful heads, such licking of
grateful lips, such playful searchings for more, and brightening
of lustrous eyes, and such romps together in the clean,
fresh, crisp straw, with mutual kissings, and rubbings, and
fondlings of all sorts. My heart is sad when I think of them—even
though I know that they are made much of and are
well cared in other homes—and though so many joys are
spared to me in mine.</p>

<p>In conclusion, let me advise all who are determined to
maintain a prejudice against cooked food, or whose limited
stable accommodation may not admit of the erection of
even the most simple contrivance for cooking it, to procure
a corn-crusher and <em>see that it is made good use of</em>. To
purchase such an article, and then allow it to stand idle
in the stable is a course of procedure somewhat similar
to that adopted by Lever’s West-countryman, who bought
himself a new coat, and said it was “a fine thing to sit
lookin’ at on a Sunday morning.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br />

<span class="chapter-title">STABLING.</span></h2>


<p>I think it highly probable that horse-owners who read
this chapter will be already supplied with stabling, be it
such as it may, and I think it equally probable that whereas
some will be ready to compare their premises with those
that I shall advocate, and be anxious to effect such improvements
as I shall venture to suggest, others will turn scoffingly
away from my hints, with the declaration that they have
kept horses all their lives, and have pulled along very
well indeed without any of the new-fangled nonsense of
the present day. Of course it is not for such persons
that I care to write, or want to do so; on the contrary,
I prefer to address my remarks to those who desire
to learn. By setting forth the exact principles on which
a stable should, according to my ideas, be built and
managed, I shall be affording information to such as shall
either be desirous of building anew, or of effecting a series
of alterations in premises discovered to be faulty—although
hitherto perhaps considered complete.</p>

<p>To begin then. If choice of situation can be had, select
that which will admit of draining, and shelter from cold
winds. The aspect should be southern, and the soil dry.
<a id="Page_251" href="#Page_251" class="pagenum" title="251"> </a>
A stable ought never to be built in a hollow, or near a
marsh, nor ought the foundation to be sunk in clay. These
things generate damp, and where this evil exists we may
expect to find coughs, farcy, glanders, bad eyes, and a
thousand attendant misfortunes. If the foundation of a
stable cannot be of chalk or well-drained gravel, the proper
plan will be to excavate, put in superior drains, and fill up
the area to be occupied with concrete. The surface drainage
may be connected with the underground, if desired, or
may be quite distinct from it. Surface drains, if not constructed
in a manner that will admit of their being cleaned
out from day to day, had best be dispensed with, and open
channels substituted, leading <em>to the outside</em> of the stable.</p>

<p>Walls should be composed of bricks, glazed on the inside,
as such do not hold any dirt. Posts should be of oak, in
preference to iron—and of the same stout material divisions
of stalls and boxes should be made. If expense is not an
object, however, brick will be better still for the construction
of these.</p>

<p>The roof of a four-horse stable should be at least ten
feet high, and that of a six-horse twelve to fourteen, which
will be ample. When too lofty, a cold atmosphere prevails;
when too low there is need for very large ventilators,
which create a current, not always either safe or
pleasant.</p>

<p>I do not at all approve of paved flooring, although it is
so general. Roughened asphalte is the best; or a most
perfect floor may be made by laying a concrete foundation,
made up with gas-tar, some three or four inches thick, with
<a id="Page_252" href="#Page_252" class="pagenum" title="252"> </a>
stable clinkers set and bedded in it, and the whole grounded
in with Portland cement.</p>

<p>I am a great advocate for box stalls, and would never
allow an animal of mine to be tied up by the head. It is a
barbarous and cruel practice, leading to all kinds of evils,
both visible and concealed. A box should be <em>at least</em>
twelve feet by fourteen, and I prefer it much larger. If it
be of brick, it ought to be lined with wood, and this again
with zinc in all places that the horse can use his teeth
upon. Projections of every kind should be avoided, as
they are apt to be injurious when the occupant moves
rapidly, or rolls to refresh himself. In a stalled stable a
box may be made by converting the end stall into one.
This can readily be done by having a gate that can be
hung on the stall-post and fastened against the wall. A
screen, hung on rollers from a top bar, is better than a door
for closing up a box-stall. It never gets out of order, nor
can any horse—even the most ingenious—succeed in opening
it when once it is let down.</p>

<p>Where stalls are used they ought to be at least ten feet in
length, and six and a-half or seven in width. The flooring
of stalls should never slant to any perceptible degree.
When it does there is a continual strain upon the back
sinews and flexor muscles of the horse, and this he strives
to relieve by moving backwards, and resting his hind toes in
the gutter,—a practice which grooms call a vice.</p>

<p>A stable door ought not to be less than eight feet high;
this will enable a horseman to ride out when mounted.
It should be quite five feet wide, and divided into two
<a id="Page_253" href="#Page_253" class="pagenum" title="253"> </a>
parts, upper and lower, in order that the former may be
conveniently opened in warm weather. It should likewise
be free of any fastening that projects in even an apparently
trifling degree.</p>

<p>Good ventilation is an absolute necessity in a stable;
but in saying this I do not mean that it should be overdone.
Up to the year 1788 the subject was but little
thought of, and ever since that period there has been a
constant outcry against “hot” stables. Such, no doubt,
are highly dangerous, but so are cold ones; and many
persons insist upon confounding <em>hot</em> with <em>foul</em>, whereas the
terms need have no connection whatever with one another.
In cases of sickness it may be necessary to keep a horse in
a warm stable, but no ailment that ever was heard of can
possibly be benefited by being nursed in a foul or vitiated
atmosphere. There is a great deal of talk about temperature
with regard to stables, but very little indeed concerning
purity: a matter which ought really to engage far
more attention.</p>

<p>To ventilate a stable properly there ought to be apertures
for taking away the foul air, and further apertures for
admitting a fresh supply—and these must be placed high
up, near the roof; otherwise they will tend to make the
stable unduly cold.</p>

<p>When air is exhaled from a horse’s lungs it is both
lighter and warmer than that which surrounds it, consequently
it ascends to the highest part of the building, and if
permitted to escape there it can do no harm. If, however,
there is no aperture so high up, it remains at the top until
<a id="Page_254" href="#Page_254" class="pagenum" title="254"> </a>
it grows cold, and then descends, to be breathed and rebreathed
by the animal over and over again. I cannot get
persons to believe this, or even to understand it. The
rooms that they themselves occupy are at times positive
hotbeds of unwholesomeness—every window shut tight,
doors likewise shut and often heavily curtained, while sandbags
are employed in various directions to exclude every
breath of fresh air. Such persons sleep all night long in a
vitiated atmosphere, and think that they are doing wonders
if, in the event of the morning being excessively bright and
fine, they open a little bit of the window <em>from the bottom</em>.
To tell them that this is injurious would have no effect
whatever; it is comfortable, feels warm, at least—and what
matter about the rest? “New-fangled notions: nothing
else”—and so on, and so forth.</p>

<p>Impure air in stables is one of the evils to be <em>most</em>
guarded against. There may be openings large enough to
admit a certain quantity of fresh air, but they are of little
use unless there are others also for the purpose of letting
out that which has been already breathed, before it has had
time to grow cool.</p>

<p>The best windows by far, both for lighting and ventilating,
are ordinary <em>sash-windows</em>, well constructed, and
reaching quite to the ceiling. These should be made to open
readily at top and bottom, and should be fitted with cords
and pulleys of the very best description. I know, of course,
all the modern appliances off by heart, and am quite ready
to admit the excellence of some of them—indeed, many—but
for general all-round usefulness I prefer the kind that
<a id="Page_255" href="#Page_255" class="pagenum" title="255"> </a>
I have advocated. Sash-windows are capable of affording
a splendid current of air: when the horses are out, for
instance, or when the weather is tremendously hot—and
they can be made available for the same purpose even
when the occupants of the stalls and boxes are in their
places without creating a dangerous draught, for the air
can be directed ceilingwards by means of screens or wire
blinds.</p>

<p>Another advantage that sash-windows possess over other
kinds is that there is nothing about them to get out of
order, except the cords—and these can, of course, be quite
readily renewed; in fact, most handy stablemen are capable
of effecting such simple repairs without having to
enlist the services of outsiders at all.</p>

<p>I like to see windows glazed with rough plate; it is extremely
strong and durable, and is in every way to be
commended before the 18-inch glass, which is both frail
and shabby. Blinds ought to be fitted to the windows, or
outside shutters employed, in order to keep out the heat
and glare in summer time.</p>

<p>Stables should be well lighted. I do not at all approve
of the half-and-half system of lighting which generally prevails,
and I strongly <em>condemn</em> the darkness which is too
often to be found in them. I cannot be made to believe
that horses, children, flowers, or anything else, can possibly
thrive and be healthy in the dark. Abundance of light and
air is my maxim, and I smile to myself when I see persons
blinking disconsolately in the sunlight, and wondering
where the “draughts” are coming from. Those accustomed
<a id="Page_256" href="#Page_256" class="pagenum" title="256"> </a>
to live in hot-houses call every breath of air a
<em>draught</em>, and because it is the fashion (a most pernicious
and objectionable one) to darken up dwelling-houses until
every ray of God’s beautiful sunshine and sweet glad light
is entirely excluded, they think that to enter a room where
all the blinds are up, and where sunshafts are darting in
through pleasantly opened windows, is something too awful
to be endured. In like manner, grooms will, when allowed,
shut out every ray of light from the houses in which
their charges spend the long hours of their captivity, and
will tell you—if you have the patience to listen to such
nonsense—that “horses thrive better in the dark.” Do
not believe a word of it. Just watch a horse brought suddenly
out of a dark stable, in daylight, into the yard; look
closely at his eyes, how the pupils instantly contract, and
the lids rise and fall, with a rapid pained movement, not to
be mistaken. The animal cannot see a single yard before
him, and when he stumbles, or halts, or steps gingerly, the
groom has harsh names and cruel punishments ready for him
at command, provided always that the master or mistress
does not happen to be by. You should <em>insist</em> upon having
a plentiful supply of light and air for your horses, for by
so doing, although “death cannot ultimately be defeated,
life may be prolonged.”</p>

<p>I do not disapprove, as some do, of having the hay loft
directly over the stable, but I greatly object to the common
method of dispensing the contents of it through a trap-door in
the roof. It is a most pernicious practice, allowing draughts
to penetrate right down upon the horses’ heads, and filling
<a id="Page_257" href="#Page_257" class="pagenum" title="257"> </a>
their eyes and nostrils with hay-seeds and dust. Naturally
when an animal knows that it is feeding-time, and sees the
opening of the trap, its head is uplifted to catch the first
morsel, and, as a consequence, its sensitive organs suffer at
once. Moreover, there have been times when the fork,
carried in the hand of a careless stableman, has slipped
from him through the opening, and inflicted serious injury
upon the occupant of the stall below.</p>

<p>When the hayloft is over the stable the floor of it should
be of brick or concrete; if of wood, there will always be a
difficulty about excluding vermin, which are the pests of
every ill-managed stable.</p>

<p>The outer yard should be partially roofed, but where this
is not the case there ought to be an adjacent room with a
paved or asphalted floor, for purposes of clipping, singeing,
&amp;c., none of which operations ought ever to be performed
in a stable or box.</p>

<p>For night lighting I approve of gas, when available;
and if in the country, of lamps fixed with staples. Provision
should be made for an abundant supply of water,
arranged according to the source from whence it is most
readily derivable; and to the ordinary stable apparatus,
a long water-hose, together with a number of fire buckets,
ought to be added.</p>

<p>The rack, manger, and drinking-trough should be level to
the horses’ knees—the bottoms of them to reach almost to
the level of the ground. This arrangement enables animals
to eat and drink as nature intended that they should. The
manger, which should be lined with zinc, ought to be fitted
<a id="Page_258" href="#Page_258" class="pagenum" title="258"> </a>
with a footguard; it is an excellent preventive against waste
of food while eating.</p>

<p>I look with abhorrence upon the ordinary water-pot with
chain and plug. It soils the water if not kept most scrupulously
clean, and frets the horse besides. I approve of
those that move upon a pivot, thus enabling the refuse
liquid to be at once turned out, and the pot itself kept
perfectly sweet and clean.</p>

<p>For bedding I do not think that anything is better than
prime wheaten straw, properly shaken down and evened, to
secure the comfort of the horse when he stretches or rolls.
To leave it in lumps is both wasteful and cruel, for when it
is so an animal cannot rest upon it for more than a very
short period of time. He becomes restless and disquieted,
he fidgets about, just as we do when we have the misfortune
to be put to sleep on a hard, lumpy, uncomfortable bed,—and
by-and-by he stands up, fretted, and declines to stretch
himself any more. Thus his rest is disturbed and broken,
and he is unfitted for his work next day.</p>

<p>Straw must of course be frequently changed, according
as it becomes littered, broken up, or damp. It is sometimes
left open to the inroads of dogs and poultry, a thing
that ought to be guarded against for various reasons, among
which may be counted the liability of vermin, which very
soon find their way to the horse.</p>

<p>The best place for a granary is over a shed or coach-house.
It ought to be a cool, airy apartment, with concrete
floor, and walls lined with glazed brick. In small establishments
the corn chest supplies the place of one. This,
<a id="Page_259" href="#Page_259" class="pagenum" title="259"> </a>
if used, ought never to be kept in the stable, owing to the
chances so frequently occurring of its being left open by
mistake, and horses breaking loose and gorging themselves
almost to death. It should be placed in a loft, with a tube
or shaft attached to bring the corn to the place where it is
required.</p>

<p>Every stable ought to be provided with a copper, or boiler,
for heating water and cooking food. This, both in town
and country, should be considered an indispensable appendage.
It is a great advantage, as well as a saving, to have
the boiler made of malleable iron, which will stand every
kind of hard usage without sustaining injury. It should be
placed in a room that will afford space for all kinds
of cooking implements, coolers, pails, &amp;c., and a supply of
coals as well. The entrance to this should be sufficiently
wide to admit a good-sized wheelbarrow, or a cooler on
wheels, and there should be a good lock to fasten the door.
The furniture ought to include a couple of iron ladles
for mixing or measuring the food, and a water-pipe with a
stopcock running into the boiler.</p>

<p>The stable “cupboard,” or press, must not be overlooked.
It is a receptacle intended to hold working implements—such
as combs, brushes of all kinds, sponges, scissors,
chamois leathers, or “shammies,” as servants call them for
shortness—and a variety of other matters. The groom
should have a key for this, and the master or mistress will
do well to have another, in order that he or she may inspect
it occasionally, and ascertain that it is not put to any
improper use.</p>
<a id="Page_260" href="#Page_260" class="pagenum" title="260"> </a>

<p>A groom’s bedroom is a decidedly necessary addition to
a stable,—horses so frequently become ill in the night, or
fall to kicking, or get halter-cast when tied up, or contrive
to break loose and go wandering about the stable,—in
fact, so many things, that this special chamber ought never
to be left unprovided, or untenanted. I speak now of
establishments where a number of horses are kept; where
there is only one, or perhaps two, and that they are
properly seen to the last thing at night, there will not,
as a rule, be any actual necessity for a groom to sleep on
the premises.</p>

<p>A common appendage to many country stables is a
water-pond. It is usually made to serve for washing and
watering the horses, washing the carriage, bathing the fowls,
and drowning supernumerary pups, kittens, and stray cats.
I strongly recommend its removal—or at all events, the
removal of any servant who leads a horse to drink at it,
fetches water from it for feeding purposes, or drags any
vehicle through it for the ready disposal of the mud upon
the wheels.</p>

<p>Harness and saddle rooms should be entirely distinct from
stables. They should contain stoves or fireplaces, and should
be perfectly dry, lightsome, and well aired. There should
be an abundant supply of racks for whips, &amp;c., brackets for
saddles, pegs for bridles, a good wide shelf for miscellaneous
articles, and a lock-up press for horse-clothing, leg bandages,
and other matters of a like description.</p>

<p>A cat about a stable is a decided acquisition; therefore
secure a respectable grimalkin of steady, sober habits, and
<a id="Page_261" href="#Page_261" class="pagenum" title="261"> </a>
give her the run of the place. She and the horses will be
fast friends in a very short space of time; she will get her
own living, with the addition of a trifle of milk now and
again, and will ask no warmer bed in winter than the sleek
back of one of her equine companions.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />

<span class="chapter-title">DOCTORING.</span></h2>


<p>In all cases where a horse falls sick, or meets with an accident,
the proper course to pursue is to send at once for a
thoroughly competent veterinary surgeon. To delay about
doing so may be to lose a valuable animal, or at all events
to involve a much longer attendance than would otherwise
have been necessary, and therefore the mistaken effort at
economy which tardiness generally represents, will, in
nine cases out or ten, be entirely defeated.</p>

<p>There may be times, however—in country districts, for
instance—when to send for a surgeon will involve a very
long and wearisome delay, and when to keep an ailing or
injured animal altogether without assistance or relief until
his arrival, may be productive of most serious results; it
will, therefore, be apparent that, although a little knowledge
is in many instances esteemed “a dangerous thing,”
it is certainly not so with regard to the subject which
we have now in hand. For my own part, my knowledge
of horse-doctoring is decidedly limited, and my surgical
education still more incomplete, yet there have been
occasions on which I was able to prescribe for horses, both
my own and others’, with perfect success, and to keep pain
<a id="Page_263" href="#Page_263" class="pagenum" title="263"> </a>
and sickness at all events at bay, until the arrival of a
qualified V.S. To sit down and do nothing, or to cry and
moan over some injured favourite, is a very feeble and
ineffectual mode of action; far better be up and doing:
provided always that you know <em>what</em> to do, and do it in
the right way.</p>

<p>Now, as I do not (as stated) pretend for a moment to be
a skilled doctor, I shall content myself with giving a few
recipes (the results of my own experience), for the treatment
of ordinary well-known and common equine ailments—touching
lightly upon other matters that seem to bear upon
the subject on which I have undertaken to give advice.</p>

<p>Firstly, then, I strongly object to physicking, and think it
ought to be avoided when possible. Long ago it was a
sort of stable craze, resorted to indiscriminately, whether
needed or not. To subject a whole stud of horses to a
severe “physic” every Saturday night was as common
under our forefathers’ <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i> as to eat dinner or drink a
quart of sack. Happily, the practice is in great measure
exploded, although it is still far too general, especially in
country stables. To dose with aloes was formerly the
groom’s chief delight; nothing else satisfied him, and the
results were often unsatisfactory in the extreme. Even still
he loves physicking so very much, that to adopt the oft-followed
course of purchasing horse-balls and leaving them
in the stable-press, is a very unwise one indeed, for the
fingers of the groom positively itch to administer them, and
one will certainly be smuggled down the animal’s throat
at some entirely wrong period if his care-taker be allowed to
<a id="Page_264" href="#Page_264" class="pagenum" title="264"> </a>
have them at command. To keep a few properly compounded
balls on the premises, or, in other words, “at
hand,” is an exceedingly wise precaution, but in keeping
them I should do so under lock and key. I have scores of
times saved poor horses from the abominable punishment of
having nauseous physic thrust down their throats, by simply
treating them with continued soft mashes—five, or even six
a day, given in small quantities at a time—and so great is
my faith in this treatment, that, except in extreme cases,
where feverish and other symptoms are present and render
physic absolutely indispensable, I would never permit any
contrary system to be adopted. For merely relaxing
purposes it is far before all others.</p>

<p>When a ball must be given, have nothing to do with the
horrible contrivance known as a twitch, nor yet with a
balling-iron, which is another aversion. The use of this
latter frequently causes the operator to sustain a broken or
injured arm, for the horse throws up his head, and the
holder of the iron is fairly lifted from the ground, and, as a
rule, sustains some hurt to the limb. Even the improved
contrivance, with the aperture at the side, which is decidedly
an advance upon the old-fashioned round orifice, is open to
a variety of objections; moreover, this method of administering
medicine subjects the groom, or operating surgeon,
to extreme risk from kicks from the fore-feet. A startled
horse almost invariably rears up, and hits out madly with
his fores—a blow from one of which is not by any means
soon forgotten. I have seen a ball most skilfully given by
coaxing and encouraging the horse in the first instance,
<a id="Page_265" href="#Page_265" class="pagenum" title="265"> </a>
taking plenty of time to bring him on terms of familiarity—then
drawing his tongue gently to the right side of his
mouth, into which the right hand <em>with the ball held between
the first and second fingers</em>, was inserted, and the physic
quietly pushed down.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed, however, that the operator’s
work is over the moment that he has withdrawn his hand;
horses have a marvellous facility for bringing up medicine,
and will do so three and
four, and even five times in
succession, but rarely, I
think, if properly administered.
It is a good plan to
close the animal’s mouth at
once, and hold it so with
the left hand, while the
right gently rubs the throat
and manipulates the upper
lip. A ball can be seen,
if watched for, travelling
downward along the gullet,
and once it is thus viewed the task of physicking may be
considered complete.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus-265.jpg" width="394" height="400" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>HOLDING HORSE’S JAWS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It ought not, however, to be given in a hard state. If
kept made up it must be re-made and softened. A drachm
each of saltpetre, ginger, and Barbadoes aloes will form a
mild aperient, when made into a mass with a little soft soap.
If a stronger one is desired, the quantities may be doubled.</p>

<p>I object most strongly to giving medicine by a drink.
<a id="Page_266" href="#Page_266" class="pagenum" title="266"> </a>
To do so almost necessitates the use of the twitch, for the
ghastly performance cannot be got through at one effort.
Were a whole bottleful of stuff to be poured down the throat
at once, the animal would either cough it up or be choked.
It is generally therefore divided into several portions, and
the wretched patient is made to undergo the torment of
taking the liquid abomination in a succession of doses.</p>

<p>It is always best, when about to physic a horse, to banish
all extraneous aid from the stable. A number of persons
standing about, officious assistants crowding the limited
space, and would-be advisers pressing their unwelcome aid,
are things which only tend to embarrass and confuse the
operator, and render the horse so fidgetty that to do
anything with him, or for him, becomes a hopeless task.
Not more than one person ought ever be permitted to be
present, and not <em>even</em> one if his assistance can possibly be
dispensed with.</p>

<p>It is a bad thing to allow a horse to drink cold water
after he has been physicked; as warm as he can be induced
to have it will be the proper thing.</p>

<p>I feel that I ought, before passing to another portion
of my subject, to repeat my warning concerning <em>undue</em>
physicking. A tendency to inflammation is repeatedly
developed by it, and its evils are in every way both many
and great. It should be borne in mind that well-made
bran-mashes are the safest and most effectual of all laxatives,
and that any desired condition of the bowels may be
induced by regulating the number and frequency of them.
When not too often repeated they act mildly, without
<a id="Page_267" href="#Page_267" class="pagenum" title="267"> </a>
inducing any of that bodily discomfort or constitutional
weakness which throws the animal out of condition, and
renders complete rest an absolute necessity for recovery.</p>

<p>Blistering is a very common recipe for a variety of ills.
About once in every score of cases in which it is tried the
result proves that the experiment was justifiable—yet, it
cannot be denied that there are times at which the remedy
may in every way be suited to the disease. Blisters are,
however, far too powerfully compounded; instead of being
so severe as to take off hair and skin together, they ought
to be diluted with quite three times their bulk of either
soap-solution or bland oil. To fire an animal and then
blister him is a piece of barbarity which no educated or
feeling person would ever permit. Fancy searing the
legs of a timid creature with a fiery iron, and then setting
a man with a coarse rough hand to rub into the raw and
quivering flesh the fearful blistering substances which are
unfortunately in only too common use. No wonder that
the sufferer moans in its agonies, and paws the earth, and
sweats and shivers from the extremity of its torture; and
after all, if people will only believe it, the treatment is
(for <em>any and every</em> evil) most palpably wrong. Simultaneous
firing and blistering cannot effect good, except in the opinion
of ignorant grooms and farriers; therefore, such unspeakable
cruelty ought never to be permitted.</p>

<p>It should be remembered, when blistering, that the action
of the remedy depends more on the amount of friction
employed in applying the agent, than on the bulk of
vesicatory stuff employed. Brisk rubbing will be highly
<a id="Page_268" href="#Page_268" class="pagenum" title="268"> </a>
beneficial, but roughness may well be dispensed with—and
adjacent tender places should be previously covered with a
layer of simple cerate, which will be a wise as well as a
merciful precaution. A little at a time, also, of the blistering
fluid should be rubbed on; if there is too much it is
apt to run upon parts that may be injured by its agency.
A blistered horse should be as mercifully cared, and as
gently treated during healing time, as a human patient.
How earnestly do I wish that I could impress this upon
persons who, without really meaning to be cruel, are so,
through carelessness, or lack of striving <em>not</em> to be.</p>

<p>Bleeding is another matter concerning which horse-owners
ought to be cautious about placing too much confidence
in grooms. If the blood-can is made to contain
two gallons—which most of them are—the groom will, ten
to one, drain the animal to fill it, or very nearly so, whereas
the loss of a quart of blood would probably be quite enough
for him to sustain. Horses are very generally bled after
coming in from grass, when they look fat and full-bellied;
but I do not consider it a wise proceeding. As a rule, it is
far better not to bleed at all without the advice of a competent
V.S., and few of the better educated of the profession
will be found very often advocating it.</p>

<p>When a horse must be bled, see that his eyes are
efficiently bandaged, in order that he may not start when
the wound is about to be given. Make use of a fleam in
place of a lancet; it is better and more effectual, for it does
not inflict a cut of unnecessary dimensions, as the lancet (if
at all unskilfully handled) occasionally does. When the
<a id="Page_269" href="#Page_269" class="pagenum" title="269"> </a>
proper quantity of blood has been extracted, remove the
pressure, and as soon as the flow ceases, prepare to pin up.
This is rather a nice operation, but I have seen a lady
perform it quite as well as any V.S. The wound should be
left open until the lips of it become sticky; then all hairs
must be most carefully removed, the sides of the incision
brought together with the greatest nicety, and closed by a
twisted suture, a thing which I have made successfully in
the following way: first running a pin through the integument
at each side of the wound, and then twisting a strong
silk thread round its either extremity, after the fashion of
the figure 8 turned on its side—thus, ∞. I have stopped
the bleeding from a wound received in the hunting-field by
extemporising this kind of suture, and using a hair pulled
from the horse’s tail, in place of a silk thread.</p>

<p>When the wound has so far united as to justify the
removal of the pin, the patient should be so placed that he
cannot rub the part, and should be fed on nourishing and
readily-digested food.</p>

<p>Slings form an excellent support for a horse that is not
meant to lie down. The apparatus consists of a broad
canvas belt that goes under the belly, extending from the
points of the elbows backwards; there is a supporting shaft
at each extremity, to which the suspending ropes (carried
from either roof or stall posts) are attached; a breast-strap
and breeching keep the belt in its place. The horse is not
really suspended at all. When he is disposed to rest his
legs, he has only to bend them, and the belt receives his
weight: when tired of its support he again stands on
<a id="Page_270" href="#Page_270" class="pagenum" title="270"> </a>
his feet. The breeching for this should be very strong
and broad, and the belt well stuffed, and stitched like a
mattress.</p>

<p>Fomentations are usually not half carried out by grooms.
If, say, a leg is to be fomented, a <em>pailful</em> of thoroughly hot
water ought to be employed, and the horse’s foot put down
into it; the water should then be laved through a large
sponge, as high as the shoulder, and allowed to run down
over the entire limb. This process should be carried on for
at least half an hour, renewing the water as quickly as it
cools. If a poultice or bandage is to be applied after the
fomentation, it should be done immediately, before the leg
has time to grow cold.</p>

<p>Poultices should be large, moist, and warm, and ought
never to be tied too tightly on the affected part. A good
poultice will not need to be changed for twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Having thus described a few appliances for remedying
sickness and wounds, I proceed to say a word or two about
the commoner forms of ailments—such, for instance, as are
most calculated to need amateur doctoring, and to bring
the foregoing remedies into requisition.</p>

<p>By far the greater number of stable sicknesses are
brought about by a persistent giving of indigestible food,
while the remainder are, as a rule, due to exposure, cold,
and chills. Indigestion can only be cured by careful
dieting, and by giving water (if that liquid is, as is customary,
administered at stated intervals) <em>before</em> instead of after each
meal. By this method the gastric juices are given fair
play, which by any other can not be the case.</p>
<a id="Page_271" href="#Page_271" class="pagenum" title="271"> </a>

<p>Ordinary cold, which shows itself precisely as in the
human subject, should be treated by clothing the body,
bandaging the legs, suspending corn diet, and giving warm
mashes, with occasionally a little nitre (half-an-ounce will
be sufficient) introduced. If sore throat exists, a mustard
poultice ought to be applied. By attending early to this
common complaint, the evils attendant upon chronic cough
may be averted.</p>

<p>Inflamed and congested lungs, bronchitis, and other
dangerous chest maladies should be at once treated by a
surgeon; but pending his arrival, a good deal of danger
may be staved off by applying strong mustard poultices,
keeping up the surface circulation, and admitting plenty of
pure air.</p>

<p>I regard ringbone, glanders, roaring, and whistling, as
altogether incurable, although the second is the only one
that will prevent a horse from working, the other three
being merely partial disablements. A glandered animal
should at once be separated from his fellows, and, as a
precautionary measure, destroyed.</p>

<p>In case of worms, a dose of about four drachms of areca
nut, prepared with a grater, should be given every alternate
day, mixed well through a soft and tempting mash. If
this is not found sufficiently powerful it may be increased,
and a pint of linseed oil given to the patient. All “worm
medicines” should be banished from the stable.</p>

<p>Diarrhœa may be speedily arrested by giving bicarbonate
of potash in small half-ounce doses.</p>

<p>Where colic occurs there is often great internal suffering.
<a id="Page_272" href="#Page_272" class="pagenum" title="272"> </a>
A pint of warm gruel should be at once prepared, and in it
put an ounce of tincture of opium and oil of turpentine,
together with double that quantity of nitric ether. The
horse should be walked about as much as possible, and his
attention distracted from his pain. If the attack continues
obstinate, the dose must be repeated.</p>

<p>Inflammation of the gums, or bars of the mouth, commonly
called lampass, is a very general ailment, and when
horses are suffering from it they will not eat. I have
never tried any treatment except a gentle aperient and a
mash diet, except in one or two extreme cases where a
lance was applied. The old remedies of a hot iron or an
iron nail were mere symbols of cruel barbarism.</p>

<p>Navicular disease cannot be cured, but it may be mitigated
by blistering the coronet; and a horse affected by it
may be made to go sound for awhile by dividing the
sensitive nerves that supply the feet: an operation for
which the services of a skilled V.S. will be, of course,
imperative.</p>

<p>Foot-fever is another ailment that ought not to be trifled
with. Before the arrival of the surgeon, get the shoes taken
off, the feet put into warm poultices, and administer a purgative
medicine.</p>

<p>Thrush is both common and curable, if taken at once.
It will be necessary to remove the ragged bony particles,
and treat the foot daily with an astringent dressing, having
the horse at the same time so shod that the frog will, when
exercising, be brought quite close to the ground.</p>
<a id="Page_273" href="#Page_273" class="pagenum" title="273"> </a>

<p>The presence of a corn is indicated by lameness, and a
red spot in the horn, close to the heel. In most cases
relief may be obtained by paring away the horn, and
affixing a shoe that will effect no pressure upon the tender
portion of the foot. A horse with corns will be immensely
benefited and relieved by working him with india-rubber
soles, as by their use the pressure is taken off the heels.</p>

<p>Swollen legs, a very common ailment, will, in most instances,
speedily yield to the following treatment: Complete
immunity from hard work, regular and gentle exercise,
constant bathing with tepid water in which salt has been
dissolved, and careful bandaging with flannel.</p>

<p>Splint is very general with young horses just put to
work. I have seen it effectually cured on its first appearance
by giving the horse complete rest, applying cold water
bandages, and utilising a three-quarter shoe on the inner
portion of the foot—a course of treatment which certainly
lessens the concussion. If obstinate, the periosteum must
be divided over the newly-formed deposit, and if this fails a
blister will have to be resorted to, or—as a very last resource—firing
the affected part. If this operation is skilfully
performed <em>with a pointed iron</em>, very little blemish will
ensue. It ought to be borne in mind, however, that a
splint when once formed into bone cannot possibly be
removed, although a horse that has <em>good sound</em> legs and
even action need not by any means be rejected on account
of it.</p>

<p>Farcy is not an uncommon ailment among horses. It
is notified by a puffy swelling covered over with little
<a id="Page_274" href="#Page_274" class="pagenum" title="274"> </a>
yellowish ulcers of an ugly sort; but, if properly looked
after, it will as a rule yield speedily to judicious treatment.
The ulcers should be opened gently with a large needle or
lance, and dressed with an ointment composed of biniodide
of mercury and lard. A horse thus affected ought to have
plenty of walking exercise, with liberal feeding, and an
abundance of fresh cool air. Tonics, both vegetable and
mineral, will be found of great service.</p>

<p>Mud-fever is consequent upon wet, hardship, and improper
grooming. I never allowed my horses’ legs to be
washed after a journey, and although the uninitiated will
stare at this, and self-sufficient grooms be found to rail
against it, I advise a trial of my plan. When a horse
comes in, the dirt should be removed from his legs by
scraping, rubbing, and strong, rapid <em>wisping</em>, which will
very soon leave them ready for the finishing brush. If the
horse has white legs, they may be sponged next morning,
and dried with a towel. This is a pleasant operation to
lovers of horses, and a beautiful cleanliness is the result.
Where there is mud-fever the horse should not be worked.
A little aperient medicine may be given, and a linament
applied, composed of liquor plumbi and olive oil—or
petroleum-jelly, or “veterinary vaseline,” may be tried.</p>

<p>Despite the aptitude which many horses have to cracked
heels, I never had a case of them in my own stable, and this
immunity I attribute almost entirely to the rigidity with
which my orders against leg-washing were carried out.
Strong vigorous hand-rubbing, and perfectly dry woollen
bandages when not at work, were my preventive measures,
<a id="Page_275" href="#Page_275" class="pagenum" title="275"> </a>
and whenever my neighbours had a case of them we doctored
by applying oatmeal poultices until all inflammatory
symptoms had subsided, and then dressed the sore
parts with an ointment composed of alum and lard, with a
good admixture of zinc.</p>

<p>Saddle-galls are terribly common evils. I pointed out
the causes of them in a former chapter. Ladies’ horses
are the chief sufferers, and therefore every lady ought
to be able to attend to her own animals, should they
chance to become affected. The moment that a tender
spot is noticed, the horse’s work should at once be stopped,
and the part well bathed with <em>cold</em> salt and water. A little
fuller’s earth may then be applied. It is a great mistake,
and a general one, to begin by fomenting with hot water;
such a practice only makes the skin peculiarly delicate and
sensitive to future hurt. Where there is abrasion, the part
should be well cleansed, bathed with zinc lotion, and
smeared abundantly with zinc ointment until it heals. For
collar and harness galls the same treatment will be found
effectual, and the stuffing or padding of the articles that
have caused the injury should be looked to without delay.</p>

<p>Almost all hunting ladies know by troublesome experience
what an overreach is. I once possessed a hunter
whose hind action was so extravagant that he was constantly
hitting the fleshy heels of his fore feet, but after a
while I found a remedy, or rather a preventive, by having
the toes of the hind shoes set back, and rounded. My
treatment for the overreach was to bathe and cleanse the
wound, take away any adherent broken horn, and lay on
<a id="Page_276" href="#Page_276" class="pagenum" title="276"> </a>
a piece of cotton wool steeped in sulphate of zinc, taking
care that the torn portions of the integument were pressed
nicely into proper place, and the whole secured with a
bandage.</p>

<p>Wounds of all sorts should be most carefully washed,
bathed, and the edges brought tenderly together. When
a horse gets staked in the hunting-field, the rider ought
at once to dismount, remove the glove from his right hand,
and probe the depth of the wound with his index finger.
If not deep, there will be no danger, provided it be
attended to at once; but to prosecute a run on an injured
animal is a piece of cruelty, happily very rarely witnessed.
I strongly advise, however, that a horse so hurt should be
ridden or led quietly home, if within possible distance,
rather than that he should be removed to an adjacent
stable until sent for, which is a usual practice, meant to be
merciful, but in reality extremely the reverse, as the
animal stiffens on its injury, and suffers intensely in the
transit.</p>

<p>In cases of laceration of the wall of the belly and protrusion
of a portion of the intestines, the best thing to do
will be to remove the saddle without a <em>second’s</em> delay, press
the exposed gut very gently back into its proper place,
bring the edges of the wound together with an improvised
suture (such as I have previously described), and bandage
the whole tightly up. The horse must not be moved until
proper assistance shall have arrived for the requisite conveyal
to his stable, where he should be kept in a standing
position, with plenty of air about him, complete quietude
<a id="Page_277" href="#Page_277" class="pagenum" title="277"> </a>
and an allowance of very soft food. Should there be inflammation
about the wound, the application of warm wet
rags will serve to allay it.</p>

<p>Injuries to the knees from falling are among the
commonest ailments of the stable. Sometimes the skin
only is injured, while at others the deeper structures are
involved, and cases occasionally occur in which the bones
are absolutely laid bare. The treatment in all instances
should commence by the most careful cleansing, with warm
fomentations for half an hour or more, and should then proceed
as follows: for skin-deep injuries, tincture of myrrh after
frequent daily bathings will prove an excellent dressing:
for those of a deeper nature, the same treatment, only intensified,
and at night a soft pad of cotton wool steeped
with sulphate of zinc and secured with a bandage; when
bones or tendons are involved, the joint-oil—a white-of-egg-like
substance—will be discharged, and when this
occurs the horse’s fate is sealed: he is absolutely valueless,
and may be destroyed at once, unless he can be made of use
for stud purposes. In ordinary cases of broken knees, if
there is suppuration or proud flesh, a weak solution (about
a twelfth part in water) of bichloride of mercury will be
found useful, and in all cases the patient must be prevented
from lying down. He should be walked gently about at
intervals throughout the day, and be fed on nourishing food
of a succulent nature.</p>

<p>When a horse has to undergo any painful operation, a
merciful owner will always chloroform him. The best way
to do this is to wind a very long towel, or bandage, about
<a id="Page_278" href="#Page_278" class="pagenum" title="278"> </a>
his jaws, and form a kind of tunnel with the ends; through
this the arm should be passed, the hand holding a sponge
steeped in chloroform, which should be held steadily within
four inches of the nostrils, and only removed to transfer
the sponge to the other hand in the event of the first becoming
tired.</p>

<p>When the friend who has carried us has to be destroyed,
the kindest and easiest way to do it will be to open a vein
and blow in a little air with an instrument made for the
purpose—a sharp lance, or rather needle, hollowed in the
centre, and with an air-chamber attached. Death is then
absolutely instantaneous. If shooting is to be resorted to,
the weapon should be placed right behind the ear, in a
slightly slanting direction, the muzzle pointing for the brain.
Shooting in the centre of the forehead is frequently mere
butchery. In all instances of so sad a nature the eyes of
the victim ought to be gently bandaged, and the whole
matter conducted as silently and in the presence of as few
persons as possible.</p>

<p>Melancholy as is the destruction of an animal we have
loved, and who has loved and served us in return, it is infinitely
less so than selling a worn-out or injured creature
to servitude, which generally means hardship and a hard
and miserable death. Such barter can bring no blessing.
The eternal God of pity sends us these noblest of His
creatures with the intention that they should serve us, yet
not as slaves, and knowing that they must perish, yet not
willing that they should do so by any unrighteous or cruel
means. At our hands will their blood, I believe, be required;
<a id="Page_279" href="#Page_279" class="pagenum" title="279"> </a>
and if the faith is a peculiar one, and not deemed
worthy of general acceptance, it may at least be regarded
without ridicule and passed by without contempt.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />

<span class="chapter-title">BREEDING.</span></h2>


<p>This is essentially an age of ladies on horseback. They are
to be met with everywhere, and at all seasons: in city,
suburb, park, and country, and with the advance of equestrian
pursuits comes likewise a desire on the part of those
who take pleasure in them to be made in some degree
acquainted with the interesting subjects of breeding and
training young horses. So at least I judge from a number
of letters recently addressed to me, both at my own house
and at the office of the <cite>Sporting and Dramatic News</cite>,
requiring information upon matters which a few years ago
were very little thought of by ladies, and certainly commanded
no amount of attention from them.</p>

<p>With a view to answering the many questions asked me,
I propose to offer a few brief hints on the best and most
profitable method of breeding good and useful racers and
hunters—appending a chapter on a system of training,
which, having tried it myself with quite satisfactory results,
I can confidently recommend to ladies, as coming entirely
within scope of the resources ordinarily afforded them, both
by nature and surroundings.</p>

<p>Horse-breeding is a pleasant recreation for those whose
<a id="Page_281" href="#Page_281" class="pagenum" title="281"> </a>
tastes, means, and residential qualifications enable them to
carry it on, and at the same time conduce to its success.
Living in the country, for example, in a house surrounded
by good grass lands, a more delightful species of pastime,
or one of a more engrossing kind, can scarcely be sought
for or imagined, while the practical question of making
money of it may be met with the assurance that it can
be done.</p>

<p>At the present crisis it is especially advisable that
attention should be given to horse-breeding, as it is a matter
to which, when times are bad and land-culture unprofitable,
lady farmeresses and others may turn their thoughts with
greater chance of profit than when sheep, cattle, and every
description of farm produce brought more grist to the
agriculturist’s mill. Land rent is low, fodder cheap and
plentiful, and labour easily obtained. Some years ago, when
seasons were good, and farmers could sell their stock at a
fair profit, horse-culture might not under ordinary circumstances
have been found to pay; but it is entirely different
now, and never perhaps was there a period at which good
horses, especially high-class hunters, were in more substantial
demand than at present. I know some persons, particularly
in Ireland, who are ready to cry “No” to this statement,
but the most substantial proof of its truthfulness lies
in the fact that at sales, as well as at the autumn horse-shows,
almost everything that is good is speedily bought
up at fairly remunerative prices, while only those who
demand excessive rates for second and third-rate animals
carry their stock home with them, and grumble at
<a id="Page_282" href="#Page_282" class="pagenum" title="282"> </a>
the blindness of buyers and the ticklishness of the
times.</p>

<p>Without going into any unnecessary preliminaries, I may
continue my subject and say, that it will be well, when
selecting a mare to breed from with a view to the production
of high-class hunters, to choose one if possible that has
herself been a good performer to hounds,—but remember
that this is not an indispensable quality, although it may
be, and is, an important one. The breeding of the animal
chosen to represent maternity ought to be a point much
dwelt upon; it cannot indeed be over estimated—as coarse-bred
mares are, even when well mated, certain to perpetuate
unsatisfying stock. I am of opinion that compactness of
form, robustness of frame, and capability of endurance,
fatigue, and exertion, are far before actual beauty in the
brood mare. I like to see short stout legs, thick and bulging
in the upper portion, denoting plenty of strength and
muscle—good, fleshy, <em>sloping</em> shoulders, a deep chest, high
withers, a strong well-ribbed frame, big broad loins, hips
wide apart, substantial quarters, a high arched crest, a good
sound mouth, nostrils wide and healthy, and, most important
of all, a sound and well-formed foot. This last
point should be rigorously observed, for my experience has
taught me that no outward defect is more surely hereditary
than small, narrow, ill-shapen, or unhealthy feet.</p>

<p>The same precautions may in great degree be applied
to the sire—and as he is supposed to supply the locomotive
power to his progeny, an animal should be chosen that has
good hunter-like action, and not one whose paces are like
<a id="Page_283" href="#Page_283" class="pagenum" title="283"> </a>
those of a racer or park horse. His height will not be of
much consequence, provided that the mare be of suitable size,
but his general form ought to be most carefully weighed.<!--TN: added period-->
A good sound constitution on the part of both mare and sire
will be of the utmost importance in breeding, and for this
reason I prefer young strong mares for stud purposes.</p>

<p>It is with many a very vexed question whether or not a
filly is improved by having a foal. I maintain, even against
much contradiction, that she decidedly is; and I have met
with a good many sound judges who have agreed with me,
while on the other hand some old-fashioned horse-fanciers
have told me that they would not have anything whatever
to say to a “widow.” I believe that the system of keeping
a flock of idle brood mares has contributed largely towards
the impoverishing of many a promising horse-breeding company,
and a few who have had the sense to see the folly of
such a course have bred with much advantage from fillies,
without ever suffering a particle of loss by it. A young
robust three-year-old—one that has been “gentled” and
taught to jump in long reins <em>without</em> being ridden—will
prove a capital speculation as a matron, and will at four
have produced a foal which need not detain her from her
training beyond the weaning time.</p>

<p>Wealthy horse-owners, who wish to go in for breeding
racers, ought to keep their best and most promising foals
entirely for breeding purposes; and I believe that such a
speculation would answer admirably as a means of making
money, and would in time astonish the world of the turf
with a show of youngsters that would bid fair to sweep the
<a id="Page_284" href="#Page_284" class="pagenum" title="284"> </a>
land. Well-nurtured animals—those that had never been
subjected to any sort of training—would be certain to
bring forth finer and healthier specimens of horseflesh than
aged quadrupeds, who were only put to the stud because
they had met with accident, or had broken down. I cannot,
for my own part, believe in such animals perpetuating a
valuable or healthy stock; and experience has amply
proved that it is only after long periods of repose—during
which the waste and exhaustion consequent upon
training and running have become mitigated, if not absolutely
cured—that racing mares and sires attain celebrity
through the progeny that they produce.</p>

<p>Turfites might pick up many a good and paying thing,
if breeders would only relinquish some of their standing
prejudices, and be induced to set apart a certain number of
untrained animals for stud purposes, selecting the best of
the foals produced by them, and keeping these apart until
their sixth year; by so doing, they would generate a
company of clippers that would make fortunes for their
purchasers, and fairly open the eyes of the racing world.
Strange to say, the system finds but little acceptance—a
fact shown by the bad, weedy, and mis-shapen lots that
are sent out to contest many of our leading races. More
of them break down in the training than ever actually go
to the post; and, even among the starters, how few are
found in the run home really contesting the race. The
horseflesh of the country has degenerated under the pursuance
of a wrong system; and yet, it is asserted that
racing is kept up to improve the national breed of chasers
<a id="Page_285" href="#Page_285" class="pagenum" title="285"> </a>
throughout the land. How far it succeeds in its so-called
purpose, the public markets daily testify. Wretched blood
stock is everywhere to be found, and when not absolutely
what could be called wretched, it is at all events decidedly
poor. A number of the foals born never return the first
expenses of their existence, much less of their education.
Their worthlessness is soon discovered, and after awhile
they are to be met with in riding-schools and job stables,
between the shafts of cabs and carts, and engaged in a
variety of other work for which they were never meant—their
very fitness for such demeaning labour proving at
once their utter lack of value for higher callings, and
testifying the hollow ignorance of those who, from blind
prejudice, or some other inexplicable cause, tend to perpetuate
this pitiable waste and degradation.</p>

<p>So-called “blood stock” is fast contaminating the pure
native breed of the country. There is, every season, a glut
of worthless bloods; the refuse of the stud farm is sold
away to the highest bidder, and he in his turn seeks to
make temporary profit out of it, with the result of impoverishing
and deteriorating such chances of good things
as he may happen to have among his stock. Thus it goes
on from one year to another, and looks, by its continuance,
as though it were meant to go on to the very end of time.</p>

<p>My advice to would-be breeders of <em>racers</em> is, to discard
as sires and matrons all animals that have been trained for
the turf; carefully select those of good blood, pedigree,
and qualifications; reserve the best of their progeny, when
brought forth, and breed from these again, ere ever they
<a id="Page_286" href="#Page_286" class="pagenum" title="286"> </a>
are allowed to pass into a trainer’s hands. In this way,
and in this alone, will strength, stamina, courage, speed,
endurance—all that is most necessary in a racer—be
absolutely ensured.</p>

<p>To turn back to the subject of breeding a good class of
hunters—a matter which I hope will interest ladies, for
whom I write—I have already given my ideas respecting
the best sort of mares to select for the purpose; and I may
add that an animal during the period of gestation ought
not to be by any means kept and fed in idleness. Gentle
regular exercise, and plenty of it, will be good and healthful
for a mare that is in foal. Her prospects of maternity
dating from May, she can with advantage be lightly
worked about a farm, or in any other way—<em>provided that
she has been accustomed to it</em>—until Christmas; and even
when actual work is suspended, daily exercise should be
carefully continued.</p>

<p>Dry uplands, and grassy ground of a hilly nature, are
excellent pasturage for brood mares, who should be kept
perfectly cool, and free from excitement of all kinds. An
abundance of fresh water should be allowed them—as
much indeed as they care to drink—together with a <em>varied</em>
supply of light nourishing food of a cooling nature. The
shelter-shed ought to open to the south, the entrance to it
being wide, and the flooring hard and very dry.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus-287-f.jpg" width="550" height="369" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>PREPARING THE STABLE.</p>
  <p class="right"><i><a href="#Page_287">page 287</a>.</i></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The mare should be left quite to herself when foaling,
except in extreme cases, which fortunately very rarely
occur. It will, of course, be necessary to see that she does
not make her way to any dangerous place—such as an ugly
<a id="Page_287" href="#Page_287" class="pagenum" title="287"> </a>
ditch, or cutting—a thing very commonly attempted in the
country—but otherwise she ought not to be subjected to
any kind of interference. This, I should observe, applies
as a matter of course to strong healthy animals, such as are
accustomed to pasturing out in almost every sort of weather;
in other cases, it will be well to have a box at hand, thickly
littered over, and lined about the walls with piled-up trusses
of straw.</p>

<p>If you are the mare’s owner, and that she knows you
and is comforted by the sound of your voice, keep close by
her, and banish all others to a distance when her sufferings
begin. These will most likely be short, but severe, and she
will not in all probability bear them very patiently. Lead
her quietly into the box that you have prepared; and
on no account permit any fuss or excitement, or any <em>peeping</em>,
to take place about her. In cases where much heaving
of the flanks has occurred, I have seen small doses of
sulphuric ether and cold water—an ounce of the former
to three pints of the latter, well blended—given with
seeming advantage; but I do not undertake to advocate
<em>any</em> physicking whatever at so excessively trying a period,
preferring for my own part to leave Nature to herself,
except where danger is anticipated: in which case it will be
best to send at once for the most skilled assistance possible.</p>

<p>As soon as matters are safely over, leave parent and
offspring to themselves, ensuring for them the utmost
quietude, as well as perfect freedom from even the very
slightest noise. All that the mare will stand in need of at
the conclusion of her troubles will be a pail of warm gruel,
<a id="Page_288" href="#Page_288" class="pagenum" title="288"> </a>
with a dash of old ale, or a little brandy introduced—the
latter only in case of great exhaustion. The foal will require
no care, except from its parent. Should the natural nourishment
prove unprolific, the young one may be supplied with
cow’s milk that has been skimmed, sweetened, and slightly
warmed. An infant’s feeding-bottle will serve admirably
for purposes of nutrition, or if such be not available, a
hand may be dipped in the milk, and the tops of a couple
of fingers lifted up. The hungry foal will very soon seize
upon them; but it is, in my opinion, better not to feed at
all, except in cases where the youngster shows signs of
evident weakness, or that the mother is unable to fulfil
her natural functions.</p>

<p>I always advocate holding up the feeding-pail when
nourishment is supplied to the parent. It gives confidence,
allays suspicion, and helps to tame the little one, which,
after a while, will venture to pick from the hand.</p>

<p>The nursing-stable should be airy and well ventilated,
without being subject to draughts, and the feeding for the
matron should consist of moist mashes, composed of bran
and scalded oats, varied with an abundance of cooling
vegetable food, and a constant supply of fresh soft water.</p>

<p>Four days after foaling the mare may be put to light
exercise: it will do both her and her colt a vast deal more
good than being idle, and the little youngster (owing to the
constant proximity of his dam’s attendant) will soon grow
quite tame. His timidity will vanish, he will suffer himself
to be handled and caressed, will pick food out of his
mother’s manger, and will, when October comes round, and
<a id="Page_289" href="#Page_289" class="pagenum" title="289"> </a>
he has to be weaned, be as docile and full of confidence as
any animal in the stable.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus-289.jpg" width="450" height="440" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>FRATERNIZING.</p></div>
</div>

<p>When that special time arrives, give him (if possible) a
companion of his own age to bear him company: because
he must be separated from his dam, for the benefit of both—and
he will pine if not provided with society. If one of his
own species be not conveniently obtainable, procure a young
calf, and let the two youngsters fraternize together; they
will soon be the best possible friends, and the colt will thus
keep up his condition and not waste, as he certainly will
if left to pine alone.</p>
<a id="Page_290" href="#Page_290" class="pagenum" title="290"> </a>

<p>Turn him, after weaning, into a good piece of pasture
land, and feed him twice a day with oatmeal-porridge mixed
with a quart or three pints of good sweet milk. The cost
of this is more than doubly repaid by the increased strength
and power that it affords: such feeding being far in advance
of the customary crushed beans, oats, hay, chaff, and
other strong meat (totally unfit for babes) which grooms find
such delight in giving.</p>

<p>Hunting colts should be kept during their first three
summers on good rich grass land, and be provided with a
suitable shelter, to which they can retire when the sun is
overpowering, or the weather severe. In the winter time
they should have warm boxes to rest in at night, but had
better be kept out of doors during the day, for air and
exercise. Where this treatment is adopted, there will
seldom be roarers in the stable.</p>

<p>Excellent feeding for youngsters that are meant for
hunting purposes is sliced mangel or swede turnips mixed
with hay that has been cut into long chaff. Crushed maize
added to the roots is also very good; and oats, peas, and
beans may be given to ensure variety. Carrots are, I think,
far before all other vegetable diet, where the soil is favourable
to the growing of a good crop; but, where they are
scarce, mangel will make an excellent substitute. Feeding
on roots alone is not advisable, even for a short period,
seeing that such are composed of 20 per cent of water, and
if not mixed with a proper quantity of grain or chaff, are
apt to produce a variety of ailments which may be found
troublesome to cure.</p>
<a id="Page_291" href="#Page_291" class="pagenum" title="291"> </a>

<p>I like to see a colt, even when a yearling, handled nicely
and lightly, and dressed every day of his life by the attendant
who has the feeding of him. Such a course fits him
for breaking-time, and prepares him in great measure
for what he has to go through in his training.</p>

<p>I am an advocate for paying close and vigilant attention
to the feet, from the very beginning. I like to see toes
nicely shaped by judicious paring, and, if disposed to chip
or splinter, provided with suitable tips.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.<br />

<span class="chapter-title">TRAINING.</span></h2>


<p>The pleasures of instructing a young unbroken colt are
so many and great, that my sole wonder is how owners of
such animals can so often make up their minds to the demands
of the professional breaker: an individual who, in
many cases, deals harshly, and in many more with a lack
of judgment which is as deplorable as it is common.</p>

<p>To enter minutely into the subject of breaking is not by
any means my intention. Volumes might be written about
it, and yet the difficulty which many persons experience in
learning from books, might not even then be overcome.
There are as many different ways of training a horse as
there are of training an infant, and I cannot at all agree
with the professedly wise ones who say that only one way
can be correct. I have found a variety of methods answer
almost equally well, and I may (in some instances) say,
almost equally <em>badly</em>, also—because everything must depend
upon the nature and disposition of the animal that is to
be experimented upon.</p>

<p>Some children are naturally timid, shy, nervous, and retiring,<!--TN: was 'rething'-->
and cannot be taught at all except by gentle encouragement—a
sort of continual leading onward, without
<a id="Page_293" href="#Page_293" class="pagenum" title="293"> </a>
any attempt to drive—while others are so sullen, obstinate,
and ill-conditioned, that gentleness seems thrown away
upon them, and nothing save fear and force are capable of
accomplishing any good. So it is, precisely, with horses;
but, just as instances of dogged obstinacy and evil disposition
are happily rare among children of well-bred parents,
so in like manner have I found it to be with colts that have
come of a good stock. I may here take occasion to say,
however, that even with the most viciously disposed animals,
such as future experience proved to be incapable of anything
either good or generous, I invariably commenced
with—and persevered in—the very gentlest treatment,
discarding all force, ignoring the uses of whip and spur,
and seeking to subdue by the mildest and most kindly
methods, until compelled to adopt severer ones by the
hopelessly unimpressionable and intractable nature of some
among my misguided charges. Having, then, found so wide
a difference of temper and disposition to exist in the various
animals with which I had to do, I long ago came to the
conclusion that to lay down any fixed laws for training
was mere fallacy and nonsense; the system that works
admirably with one may prove a dead failure with another,
and taking this into account I cannot, I think, do better in
a chapter like the present, than state the plan on which I
always began to work, and which, as a rule, I found to
succeed, better than any other.</p>

<p>Advising you by my own experience, I should say never,
when you can help it, submit young animals to a so-called
professional breaker, but rather take them in hand yourself,
<a id="Page_294" href="#Page_294" class="pagenum" title="294"> </a>
and make up your mind to three things: first, to bring all
the patience of which you are possessed to bear upon your
task, to enable you to govern by gentleness and forbearance,
and not by tyranny and wrath; second, that a colt must
be so handled and trained that he shall never find out his
own strength or power; and third, that you must give the
pupil every opportunity of seeing, smelling, feeling, and
hearing things that will at first be strange to him, remembering
that it is by the exercise of these senses that horses
form their judgment of surrounding objects.</p>

<p>I greatly object to the system of lungeing young horses
in a circle, or ring. The evils of it are sufficiently manifested
in mill-horses; but even these are suffered to <em>walk</em>
their rounds, whereas the breaker compels the youngster
to trot, and even to canter when going in a comparatively
narrow circle. Injury to the sight is the very commonest
result of the practice, and even if it does not show immediately,
or at the time, it certainly will later on. To travel
round and round at a quick rate in an ordinary ring, forces
blood to a young animal’s brain, and the faster and more
excited the pace the more certain will be the result. The
optic nerves may be said to originate from the sensorium—being,
in fact, a continuation of the brain proper—and
whenever the nervous centre is congested, the <em>sight</em> is the
first sense that becomes impaired. There are other evils
also connected with the system into which I need not go;
suffice it to say that I regard it as a highly objectionable
one.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>MAKING FRIENDS WITH THE YOUNGSTERS.</p>
  <p class="right"><i><a href="#Page_294">page 294</a>.</i></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The tuition of a colt may be begun when he is three
<a id="Page_295" href="#Page_295" class="pagenum" title="295"> </a>
months old, provided that he has been “gentled” almost
from its birth. This can be done by frequently passing the
hands over his body and down his limbs, dressing his mane
and tail, pulling and stroking his ears, speaking caressingly
to him, and in short winning his confidence by uniform
manifestations of kindness and good will.</p>

<p>The earliest trappings should be a small bridle and
surcingle made of very soft wash-leather, or calico—the
intention being merely to indicate the maturer harness
that is destined to succeed. Later on, when a cavesson is
adopted, it must be most carefully fitted to the colt’s head.
The noseband is not to be too high, lest it be deprived
of power—or yet low enough to rest on the soft cartilages of
the nose, for fear of impeding respiration and causing pain
to the animal by any jerk that it may chance to receive.
It must also fit sufficiently accurately not to turn round
when the rein is drawn tight.</p>

<p>The first regular bit employed should be made of india-rubber,
and this may be immediately followed by a very
smooth plain snaffle, with players, or a “Rarey” bit,
with wooden roller, which is very mild and nice for a
beginner.</p>

<p>When you first adjust the mouthpiece do not rein the
colt’s head up to any point beyond that at which he
<em>naturally holds it</em>: no matter whether that be high or low.
Give him his preliminary lessons in an enclosed place—a
big barn or riding-school will be best, if you happen to be
near one. Accustom your pupil to the sight of <em>everything</em>
with which he is destined to make subsequent acquaintance:
<a id="Page_296" href="#Page_296" class="pagenum" title="296"> </a>
the mounting-block, saddle, stirrups, and so forth;
and remember that you cannot talk to him too much, or
give him too frequent handling.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus-296.jpg" width="354" height="300" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>RAREY SNAFFLE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Forbid the presence of other animals while you are
acting as instructor, as also of any object, human or otherwise,
that will be likely to distract your pupil’s attention.
Stand and walk on his <em>left</em> side, keeping pretty well back
from him—and deal him out plenty of rein, or strap—just
letting him feel the weight of your hand when he attempts
to run from you, but not on any account drawing him in.
By degrees you can shorten the rein, and when he has
learned to let you walk alongside of him without running
back or showing timidity, begin to teach him to lead: not
by pulling him after you, or hunting him forward, but
by bringing him very <em>very</em> gently round in a half-circle—a
plan which will oblige him to shift his foot and bend his
neck to your guidance. Take him both to right and left
in this way, encouraging and caressing him when he obeys
<a id="Page_297" href="#Page_297" class="pagenum" title="297"> </a>
you, and he will learn his lesson in a wonderfully short
space of time.</p>

<p>As soon as you find that he leads well in an enclosed
place, take him out into an extremely quiet paddock, not
allowing anybody to come near you while you do it.
A good method will be to grasp the reins, close to the jaw
with your left hand, while your right catches the mane,
and by this means lead him gently out for an open-air
spell of instruction. Then proceed as when under cover,
and repeat the lesson every day.</p>

<p>At eighteen months old a colt that has been bred on your
own land ought to have gone through <em>all</em> the preliminaries
of his education, and at that age the dumb-jockey may be
brought into use with a pair of imitation legs and light
little stirrups to hang on either side. Reins formed
partially of india-rubber should be passed through the
terrets and fastened to the bit, and these must not be
drawn <em>by any means tight</em>, lest the colt be induced to bear
upon them—or lest he rear, and fall backwards.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour is the longest period that a lesson
of this description ought to occupy, and the pupil’s mouth
should be well wetted both before and after. If terror is
excited, the utmost encouragement should be given, and no
harshness be for even an instant resorted to.</p>

<p>These lessons may be continued, with slight variation,
until the young animal shall have entered his third year,
at which epoch a very light rider may be mounted on him,
with rigid instructions not to interfere in any way with the
bridle, except as a means of guiding. In fact, to prevent the
<a id="Page_298" href="#Page_298" class="pagenum" title="298"> </a>
possibility of his doing so to any mischievous degree, the
india-rubber reins may with advantage be continued; but
the best way of all will be to back the animal yourself:
always provided that you are a sufficiently light weight
for the purpose.</p>

<p>When the saddle is first placed in position, the extremest
gentleness must be observed. Allow him, beforehand,
to look at it, smell it, in short satisfy himself about it,
and then proceed to rub it softly down his neck, pausing
if he shows fear, and slipping it gradually backwards until
you quietly lift it into its place. When it is fairly
on his back, you should lift it again, and again replace
it, and keep moving it gently about in order to give
him confidence, and when you have induced him to stand
quite still, fasten it with a <em>racing surcingle</em> instead of an
ordinary girth, as it is more readily adjusted, and need
not be drawn so tight.</p>

<p>To mount him successfully, place him so that the
mounting-block shall be just behind his shoulder; ascend
the block with the utmost coolness and quietness, and
while standing on it proceed to pet your pupil, stroking
him, talking to him, and “gentling” him as though he
were a timid child. If he shows signs of alarm, go no
further for a while, but wait quietly—no matter how long it
may be—even deferring the lesson to another day, until
he shall have gained complete confidence in your instructions.
Half the horses that refuse to stand to be mounted
have been rendered rider-shy (if I may coin a word) by
scolding, and harsh treatment shown them in their early
<a id="Page_299" href="#Page_299" class="pagenum" title="299"> </a>
training. No attempt should be made at mounting a colt
until he has become perfectly reconciled to his trainer’s
standing over him, and also to the pressure of a hand on
the saddle, and a foot passed in and out through the
stirrup. To facilitate his standing quiet, place his head to
a wall,—or, if he must be held, entrust the task to a steady
quiet man, who will stand straight in front of him, fondling
his nose and ears, and who will when necessary lay hold of
the <em>cheeks</em> of the bridle, <em>above</em> the bit, but never of the bit
itself, nor yet of the reins.</p>

<p>Do not, when mounted, touch the animal with your heel
to start him, or attempt to meddle with his mouth in any
hurried way. Speak to him coaxingly, and draw one rein
very gently, in order to make him shift his leg and move—then
walk him quietly about, repeating the lessons in
turning, stopping, and backing, which you have already
given him on foot If he shows restiveness, or an inclination
to fight, slip off <em>at once</em>, and proceed with the old
method of instruction—because you must not attempt to
battle with him until you are quite certain that you can
conquer. This is one of the most important principles in
correct training, and one which, I regret to say, is most
shamefully overlooked. “I won’t let him conquer me,”
says the ignorant breaker, when the timid creature stands
still and shivers, and refuses to do what it has not yet
learned to comprehend. Greater nonsense could not possibly
be spoken. There can be <em>no</em> victory, for either horse or man,
until there has first been a battle, and if the man is wise he
will not begin one, lest he should fail to prove himself the
<a id="Page_300" href="#Page_300" class="pagenum" title="300"> </a>
master, and the horse ever after refuse to obey his hand.
Severity in training is merely an ebullition of the breaker’s
temper, and there is no necessity for such when dealing
with a creature that is really anxious to learn and obey.
Gentle indications will, in all save extreme cases, accomplish
tenfold more than brute force. Such, at all events, is
my conclusion, after very close and practical study of the
subject in hand.</p>

<p>Leaping ought not, as a rule, to be taught until the animal
has attained its fourth year, nor ought the pupil to be
mounted during the lessons for the first three or four
months that are devoted to them. To lead in long reins,
turning the colt in a nice quiet paddock that has a low
hedge or gorsed hurdle across the middle of it, will be the
proper method, and, as all young animals are imitative, it
will be a great advantage to have an old skilled horse
taken over the jump several times in easy fashion, in view
of the youthful learner. I have made youngsters jump
brilliantly over hurdles that were raised by degrees a great
deal above their original height, by simply standing on the
off side of them with a measure of corn in my hand, and
shaking it temptingly, calling out cheerily at the same
time, and always plentifully rewarding my pupils when
the boundary had been cleared.</p>

<p>This sort of teaching is only pleasant excitement for the
colt; it is not task-work; it injures neither structures nor
temper, and is unattended by either accident or risk.
The training of horses, both racers and hunters, as at
present conducted, is conducive of many evils, as is proved
<a id="Page_301" href="#Page_301" class="pagenum" title="301"> </a>
amply by the fact that one-half the animals that come
fresh from the trainers’ hands are debilitated by the wrong
systems pursued, and are far less capable of enduring
exertion than before they were taken in hand. The physicking,
the brow-beating, the harshness, scolding, and fighting,
are one and all tremendously pernicious and wrong. The
vast majority of horses will, if properly treated, accept
their duties without force; and even the most viciously
inclined may be conquered, or at least subdued, without
any approach to brutality.</p>

<p>I may cite one case as a sample of many: an animal I
once bought for a song, and subsequently would not have
sold for any money that could have been offered. By
telling you of the method by which I contrived to cure
him of his bad name, you may be guided how to act should
any similar occasion chance to arise in your own stable.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>By the aid of a powerful dose of physic—administered
with extreme difficulty, I confess, by a strong and resolute
man—and aided by a few light whiffs of chloroform, we
succeeded in getting the horse so sick and stupid that he
suffered himself to be handled almost without opposition.
In fact, I could go up to his head, and stroke and fondle it
as though he had been the quietest animal alive. We then
littered a lofty shed with quite a foot deep of dung
and straw (tan would, however, have been better for the
purpose), and having led him into it we put on him a
single-rein bridle, with a wooden gag-bit,—this latter
because he presently showed an inclination to bite. We
then tied up the reins quite close to the withers, put a
<a id="Page_302" href="#Page_302" class="pagenum" title="302"> </a>
breaking surcingle on him, passed a soft strap round the
near pastern joint, lifted up the foot as though we were
about to shoe him, and passing the strap round over
the fore-arm, buckled it firmly, but in such a way as not to
hurt the horse. I gentled him, as much as he would allow
me, about the head, while my assistant worked, and we then
led him about the shed for twenty minutes or more, on
three legs, by which time he was tired, but seemingly too
dull to be much irritated. The next operation was to place
a second strap around the off fore-leg, draw it pretty tight,
and pass the long end of it through one of the rings sewn
on to the belly part of the surcingle. My helper then put
a big strong glove on his right hand, caught a firm hold of
the strap, and when the horse lifted his leg in an endeavour
to hop, drew it gradually close, and brought him gently
<a id="Page_303" href="#Page_303" class="pagenum" title="303"> </a>
upon his knees. Our object was to make him lie down, for
I never would countenance—under <em>any</em> pretence, or for any
operation—the forcible casting of a horse with which I had
anything whatever to do. Finding that he was sullen and
would not move, I came to the near side of him, and drew
his head gradually towards me by one rein, speaking
soothingly to him all the while; I then bade my assistant
go to his off side and bear against it, just behind the
shoulder, with a steady, even, close pressure—and after
about twelve minutes’ patient waiting, I had the joy of
seeing him lie quietly down upon the litter. So far my
plan of subduing by gentleness had succeeded.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>TAMING THE SHREW.</p>
  <p class="right"><i><a href="#Page_302">page 302</a>.</i></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The moment that he was fairly down I made his hind
legs quite fast, and then began my plan of taming. I
gently stroked every one of his limbs separately, rubbed
his trembling head, pulled and fondled his ears, unbuckled
the bit for an instant and gave him <em>from my
hand</em> sliced carrots, lettuce, and I think an apple or two.
He was in a wretched state, poor beast! for want of care
and grooming, so I got a nice brush, and went caressingly
over every part of his body with it, talking to him as
though he had been a frightened child. After an hour or
so we took off the straps, drew out his fore-legs, and
encouraged him to get up. He seemed very dazed when
he did so, but was seemingly quite subdued—and having
given him a feed, we left him alone for the night.<a id="Marker_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="marker" title="Go to note">*</a></p>
<a id="Page_304" href="#Page_304" class="pagenum" title="304"> </a>

<p>The next day we had another and worse scene to go
through; the evil spirit was not altogether gone out of the
horse, as events very soon showed us. We had to resort to
the same strapping-up process, and when he was on his
knees he actually fought with us till he turned over; but I
encouraged him to get up again (in the same cramped
position, of course), and to make a second fight—treating
him with steady firmness, and never giving in for a moment,
but striving all the time to quiet him and make him lie
down. He did so at length—from sheer exhaustion, I
believe—for his obstinacy and violence had lasted over an
hour, and I and my patience were alike almost worn out.
When he was down I scraped the sweat from him with a
scraper, gave him water and lettuce, went over every inch
of his body with a wisp, and made my assistant pretend to
shoe him, by lifting each of his feet and tapping them
gently with a hammer. Finally I showed him a saddle and
bridle, laid them under his nose, and stroked him with
them—and ended by actually putting them on him with
scarcely any difficulty at all. Then I shut myself alone
with him in the shed, and fed, petted, and talked to him
unceasingly for upwards of an hour, until all the untractableness
had seemingly gone out of his disposition. His
poor wild, bloodshot eyes grew calm and placid, and he
actually rubbed his nose at last against my hand. I am
certain that I shall be accounted a terrible fool, but I
<a id="Page_305" href="#Page_305" class="pagenum" title="305"> </a>
believe I wept for joy—and the best of it all was that I had
gained my victory without the horse having any suspicion
that he was conquered. If I had thrashed him into subjection—allowing
that such a thing were possible—he
might have obeyed me for awhile, although hating me—but
by dint of never using a particle of harshness, and
granting him <em>his own time</em> to make concessions, I am
firmly convinced that he considered himself the better
animal of the two, and was magnanimous enough to obey
me from chivalrous motives, while believing that he need
not do so at all.</p>

<p>After that day I had not any trouble with my charge,
and in less than a week I was riding him about the place
with only an ordinary bridle. He subsequently manifested
an extraordinary affection for me, and whether the system
that I pursued with regard to his taming was or was not
one of which ordinary horse-owners will be found to approve,
I can only say that it succeeded to perfection, and
that I have seen it tried twice or thrice since, on my
recommendation, with excellent results; but I never advise
the adoption of it, except in cases such as I have described,
where an animal has been rendered vicious by extreme
bad treatment, or has inherited a disposition for sullenness
and obstinacy which cannot otherwise be brought under
control.</p>

<p>Before bringing this chapter to a close, I would wish to
add that a colt in his fifth year may be ridden once or
twice a week with harriers, or once with foxhounds, if the
meet be very near his stable—but he must never on any
<a id="Page_306" href="#Page_306" class="pagenum" title="306"> </a>
account be <em>pressed</em>, or run to the end of his tether, for it
is an absolute fact that if a young animal is once suffered
to find out for himself that he is beaten, he will never <em>while
he lives</em> get to the close of a long or trying run. This may,
by some, be regarded as a fallacy, but many practical
authorities will, I think, endorse what I say.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />

<span class="chapter-title">A BUDGET OF “TIPS”.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Mouths and Mouth-pieces.</span>—The shape, delicacy, or
toughness of a horse’s tongue does not in the least contribute
towards making his mouth either tender or harsh;
but a difficulty is thrown in the way of bitting when the
tongue is broad in form, because in such case it covers the
bars of the mouth, and so prevents the mouth-piece from
acting properly upon them. The tongue is endowed with
immense susceptibility to pain or pressure, and any undue
compression of it causes intense suffering and fretting, and
entirely obviates the action of the bridle. I consider that
rollers, olives, twists, and all such devices, are not only
useless encumbrances, but are instruments of destruction
as well. The severity or mildness of a mouth-piece is
regulated by the thickness of that portion of the cannons
which acts upon the bars of the mouth. The curb-chain
ought to sit exactly on the beard, or chin, of the horse. If
he is tender-mouthed, it should be left very slack.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Country Riding-Suits for Men.</span>—If you want to ride
in luxury in the country, get measured for a knickerbocker
garment, with continuations in the form of breeches, fitting
<a id="Page_308" href="#Page_308" class="pagenum" title="308"> </a>
perfectly below the knee. This most sensible novelty can
be worn with or without leggings, so that if desired for
rough usage on the moors, the additions can be dispensed
with, or added if wanted for saddle use.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Hunting Breastplates</span> are approved by many keen
sportsmen. I give a sketch of one.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus-308.jpg" width="377" height="400" alt="Hunting Breastplate" />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Hustling Horses.</span>—Never hustle a horse at a gap,
or in a crowd, or on any account cram him at his fences.
Give him time. He has, as Major Whyte Melville
used to say, “to carry the bigger fool of the two, and to
think for both.”</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Brushing.</span>—For a horse that “brushes” procure a
leathern boot, the colour of the foot, made of prepared
<a id="Page_309" href="#Page_309" class="pagenum" title="309"> </a>
horse-skin, having the hair left on, and laced up the leg.
On, or just over the seat of injury, a concave piece of stout
leather should be let into the covering, and the hollow thus
formed (which acts as a protector) should be filled up with
a small pad of lint, previously saturated with zinc lotion.
This serves to cure the sore, and also prevents a recurrence
of it. I append a sketch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sawmouth Bridoon.</span>—This is a terribly severe bit,
and one which no good judge of training would permit to be
used among his horses. It is calculated to destroy rather
than to instruct. The illustration shows the nature of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Shoe</span> a nervous or vicious horse, or a young sensitive
<a id="Page_310" href="#Page_310" class="pagenum" title="310"> </a>
colt, take him to a skilled farrier—one who has a good
temper in addition to his other endowments—and while he
is working, take up your stand at the animal’s head, <em>at the
same side</em> as that on which the farrier is engaged. Hold the
bridle loosely in your hands, dispense with blinkers, and let
the horse see what is going on. You can manage this by
allowing him to turn his head when he tries to do so. Do
not permit any third person to come in the way during the
operation. It is a good plan to stand a horse that is to be
shod <em>close by a wall</em>. If the smith be unfortunately a duffer
at his work, instruct him to smooth the leg downwards
from the shoulder or thigh, as the case may be, lifting it
up and putting it down again, if the horse seems frightened,
and even going away for a moment, and again returning,
in order that confidence may become fully established.
The safest and surest method of overcoming irritability or
nervousness is to exercise a quiet kindness, combined with
a cool firmness of purpose; and to accomplish this end,
one, or at most two, persons, will be infinitely better than a
number. The adjoining sketch shows a horse under treatment
on principles of which I do not profess to approve,
although I am willing to acknowledge that there are cases
in which actual vice can only be overcome by severity and
brute force. The custom here depicted of casting an
intractable animal for the purpose of getting him shod is
common enough in almost all cavalry stables, and is seldom
accompanied by any cruelty, save on rare occasions, when
the attendant who carries the whip makes use of it to practical
purpose—a thing net often called for. When a horse is to
<a id="Page_311" href="#Page_311" class="pagenum" title="311"> </a>
be shod thus, the ground about him is usually covered with
sacks, to break the force of his fall; but these the artist has
not thought it necessary to depict.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Broken-winded</span> horses require regular work, and
regular feeding. A generous diet, composed of oats, beans,
and barley, will be very good for them; and in place of
hay give about six pounds of wheaten straw every alternate
day, with carrots very frequently.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Veterinary Quacks.</span>—No man has a right to be called
a veterinary surgeon who has not a diploma. A pretender
may assume the name—often does, in fact—but quackery
soon expires.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">When a Horse clears his Nostrils</span> immediately on
being pulled up, it is a sign that he has wind enough to go
both further and faster in his next gallop. When a minute
elapses the pace may still be increased though not much;
but when two minutes go over without the expected snort,
it is a proof that the exercise has been a little too hard
for the animal’s condition. Remember, when exercising a
young one, that you must not take too much out of him.
Frequent protrusion of the muzzle is a sign that distress is
at hand, and a settled thrusting forward of it shows that
the horse is at very nearly all that he can do.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Restlessness</span> in horses—or temper, as many call it—is
more frequently noticeable in summer than in winter
time, and is caused by the troublesome flies which stick all
<a id="Page_312" href="#Page_312" class="pagenum" title="312"> </a>
over the animals’ bodies. These creatures torment some
tender-skinned horses almost to madness; and when a
stamp is given, ears put back, or a leg lifted as if in pain,
immediate search ought to be made for the occasion of it.
Horses at pasture can, as a rule, defend themselves with
their teeth, feet, and tails: that is, when the latter appendages
are left them; but in this country, so eminently the
seat of wisdom and freedom, the effective instrument is
invariably removed, and Nature most unfairly handicapped,—as
if the sorrows of servitude are not sufficiently great
and numerous without augmenting them by caprice.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Bales</span> are simple bars of wood, used largely in cavalry
stables to separate the horse-stalls. They are furnished at
each end with iron links, by means of which they are suspended
to hooks fastened at the head and heel-posts.
Sometimes they are made of iron, but well-seasoned oak
is quite sufficiently strong for the purpose. The usual
dimensions are eight feet long, and four inches in diameter,
and they are placed at a distance of about three feet from
the ground. The top part may be a fixture; but one end
or the other ought to be so arranged that in case of a horse
getting partially under it when lying down, it will move
readily upwards, according as the animal pushes it in his
rise. I have a strong objection to bales, because they
admit of horses biting and injuring one another, and are in
other ways undesirable; but that they are cheaper than
travises, I am, of course, prepared to allow. It is, however,
almost their sole claim to notice.</p>
<a id="Page_313" href="#Page_313" class="pagenum" title="313"> </a>

<p><span class="smcap">An idle Groom</span> is generally an eye-server. The wisp
is oftener in his hand than the brush. When a horse does
not <em>look</em> amiss on being brought to the door, and yet that
his skin leaves a dirty whitish stain on the fingers when
they are pressed into it, the fact is proved beyond all doubt.
Thin-skinned horses will not stand a curry-comb; nor is
it necessary to use one where good strong brushes are
supplied, and <em>made a proper use of</em>.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Curry-comb</span>, when employed at all, should describe
a sweeping movement—never a rubbing one—and the
utmost gentleness should always accompany the using
of it.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">When the proper Grooming</span> of a horse is neglected,
he suffers in consequence. Lice, for instance, are never seen
in animals that are even moderately well taken care of;
but when once these pests appear, the spread of them is
amazingly rapid. Nothing but care and cleanliness will
eradicate them. Make a strong lather of black soap, wash
well with it, then again with clean water, and finally anoint
the patches where the lice are with a little mercurial ointment.
If they have spread over the surface of the body,
make a strong decoction of tobacco, and smear liberally
with a sponge. The same treatment will do for dogs.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">To remove the soft coating of Hairs</span> that grows
on the inside of a horse’s ears is not only unnecessary, but
is absolutely cruel. It has been furnished to the animal as
<a id="Page_314" href="#Page_314" class="pagenum" title="314"> </a>
a protection against dust, flies, and dirt; and when taken
away, the ears are left exposed to the influence of the three
combined. All appearance of untidiness may be done
away with by holding the ear in the left hand with the
edges of it nicely evened, and then clipping lightly along
them with a sharp scissors. I would never on any account
permit nose-hairs to be clipped, or otherwise removed.
Horses are immensely sensitive to any interference with
them, and for sundry reasons they ought not to be
meddled with.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">A Horse that is Cast under the Manger</span> cannot
possibly rise until he is drawn backwards by an attendant.
Every time that he attempts to get up he strikes his
head, and is thus brought forcibly down again. In a
properly-constructed stable such a thing could not, however,
occur.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Old-Fashioned Mangers</span> ought to be boarded in, so
that no hollow may exist under them.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Filling Horses’ Feet.</span>—I am totally against this
system, but, when those who are partial to it are bent upon
carrying it out, they should see that it is done with fresh
moss, soft and very damp, pressed well into the feet, and
tucked away on the inside of the shoes.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Semi-Military and Travelling</span> saddle is made
to fit any horse, and is in great request among officers
<a id="Page_315" href="#Page_315" class="pagenum" title="315"> </a>
serving abroad. Peat &amp; Co., of Piccadilly, have patented
it, and the sealed pattern is at the War Office.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Biting the Collar-Rope.</span>—If you want to see a horse
do this, leave him a rope about two or three feet too long;
shut him up in a close stable, and give him nothing to do.
It is not a vice, but rather one of the many signs of
weariness and idleness in which dumb animals indulge. I
append a sketch of a rope-biter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Horseman’s Skill</span> in the management of his bridle-hand
consists in the discretion with which he makes the bit
be felt. It ought never to be used too severely, and its
<a id="Page_316" href="#Page_316" class="pagenum" title="316"> </a>
effects should be moderated by the mildness and pliability
of the hand.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">When Boiling Grain</span> of any kind, give it plenty of
water, and keep it constantly stirred. If you neglect this
necessary precaution, it will stick to the bottom of the boiler,
and the burned part will acquire a nasty nauseous taste.
According as the water evaporates, add a fresh supply.
Never let the liquor boil over; it is a great waste to do so,
as it contains a large amount of nutriment. Oats will
need more boiling than beans; these latter more than barley,
carrots and turnips more than potatoes. Four measures of
oats, boiled and bursting, will fill seven measures; four of
beans, something over eight and a half; while four of barley
will fill quite ten. I have proved all these statistics in my
own stable.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">False Quarter</span> is a defect of the outer wall of the
foot. I give a sketch of the only possible relief for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rick in the Back</span> will necessitate the throwing up of
the sufferer for at least six months. He must be placed in
a roomy stall, the hair over the seat of injury be carefully
<a id="Page_317" href="#Page_317" class="pagenum" title="317"> </a>
removed, and the place kept moist with cloths dipped in a
lotion composed of tincture of arnica two ounces, and water
one pint. Soft nourishing food must be given, but no
medicine on any account whatever—the restoration to
finish with liquid blistering of a judicious kind.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The safest Arrangement for Side Saddles</span>, to
avoid risk of being hung up, or dragged after a fall, is that
adopted with “the level seat saddle,” by Messrs. Nicholls of
Jermyn Street. They have patented a bar for the stirrup
leather, extremely simple in construction, and which will
instantly disconnect it, should a rider have the misfortune
to get her foot caught when falling over the off-side of
the saddle. An elastic safety-band, stretched across the
heads, will, when a fall occurs, prevent the habit catching
on the saddle,—and the unpleasant predicament of a horse
galloping about, with his rider suspended by the skirt,
head downwards (as witnessed sometimes in the hunting-field),
will be avoided.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Take a Pistol</span> with you on all occasions when going to
hunt, and in case of hopeless injury occurring to your
mount, make use of it, with all the quietness and celerity
you can command. Horses, when left to themselves,
rarely meet with mishaps; it is, therefore, only fair
that their riders should protect them against unnecessary
torture.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Ladies’ Spurs.</span>—I have pleasure in appending sketches
of the only three of these—that I know of—that are manufactured
for ladies’ use. The Sewarrow is, I think excellent.
<a id="Page_318" href="#Page_318" class="pagenum" title="318"> </a>
Lady equestrians frequently use a small pair of
hunting spurs of the shape worn by men—the right one
having a knob in place of a rowel. These are used with
Hessian boots, and look well when dismounted. The spike
of the spur is in all cases made amply long to fulfil its
purpose; to wear one of immoderate length would necessitate
having it made specially, and could not effect any
good. I like “box” spurs myself, and have always worn
them; but there is nothing objectionable in the strap, and
it has the advantage of being readily adjusted to any sort
<a id="Page_319" href="#Page_319" class="pagenum" title="319"> </a>
of boot, whereas boots fitted with box spurs are generally
costly articles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Crib-Biting</span> may be prevented by removing all woodwork
from the vicinity of the horse, and if he persists in
gnawing his stable-partitions, smear them well with aloes,
and he will soon desist.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dishing</span>” is a common expression among horsey
people. It signifies throwing out the forelegs in a kind of
side manner, which looks badly in the trot. I have seen
some very good horses do it, but it would certainly be
<a id="Page_320" href="#Page_320" class="pagenum" title="320"> </a>
called defective action. To “dish” with one foreleg only
is a very frequent thing.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Bandaging.</span>—When a horse’s legs have to be bandaged,
it is a good plan to coil the bandages completely round
the pastern, close to the hoofs, winding them around the
legs in spiral form (each coil overlapping the other) until
the legs are bound up to the knees or hocks, where the
bandages are secured. The pressure must be equal, and
not too tight. The strings should admit a finger after
being tied. I have never found a horse so treated attempt
to lie down, and it is far less irksome to an animal than
being tied up by the head.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Habit-cutting</span> is now perfection at most of the high-class
London houses. Bodices are exquisitely made—some
with stand-up collars, others slightly lapelled, to
show a portion of habit-shirt or tie. The backs are cut
with long seams, and the buttons placed low, so that even
a naturally short-waisted figure appears the contrary, being
lengthened and improved. The shaping in front is excellent.
The skirts are so artistically cut and seamed that
they fit at the back as closely as a man’s hunting breeches,
while the shaping at the knee is supplemented by a most
artistic and novel arrangement underneath, a sort of hollow,
into which the up-pommel fits completely, thus obviating
the necessity of having folds of cloth lying between the
right leg and the saddle. These skirts, held back by the
hand when the wearer is dismounted, look neat, and are of
convenient walking length.</p>
<a id="Page_321" href="#Page_321" class="pagenum" title="321"> </a>


<p><span class="smcap">Wall-licking.</span>—If a horse shows a tendency to this,
leave a lump of chalk in his manger. A piece of rock-salt
left there as well will never be amiss.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Signs of Megrim.</span>—When a horse suddenly throws up
his head, and holds it in the air and on one side, be assured
he has a megrim, and will be in danger of falling if driven
further without a stop. Pull up at once, and if cold water
can be had anywhere within reach of you, dash a bucket of
it over his head and neck.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Benumbed Leg.</span>—When, for taming purposes, a horse’s
leg is strapped up for any length of time, it becomes
benumbed, and ought, when let down, to be rubbed
vigorously before the animal is allowed to walk upon it
If this is not done he will probably fall.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Hints for Amateur Jockeys.</span>—The moment you
know that you are beaten in a race, pull up. You can gain
nothing by flogging your horse to the finish. If going well
and gamely, let him alone; if not, catch him with both
hands, and give him two or three kicks with the spurs, I
never advocate waiting, unless the mount is a very game
one. Jump off with the lead, and hold it as long as you
can.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Age Symptoms.</span>—A horse that has passed his fourth
year has four incisors in each jaw, all fully grown.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">A Seated Shoe</span> signifies a regular, or ordinary, shoe,
which has only as much upper surface left as will admit of
the crust resting upon it.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Hiring Horses.</span>—Windsor, Cheltenham, and Oxford
<a id="Page_322" href="#Page_322" class="pagenum" title="322"> </a>
are about the best places I know of for jobbing light-weight
hunters. When an animal is found to suit, it ought to
be at once secured for the season. Horses can be had
at Barnstaple for Exmoor. Oxford is within reach of five
packs of fox-hounds. Capital hunting quarters can be
had there, and excellent horses—cheap too, in vacation
time, as there is not any one to ride them.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Defective Vision.</span>—A horse that has any defect in his
sight should be at once rejected by the buyer. It is the
only safe way in dealing, unless the desire is to buy a blind
animal at a blind price. There is generally a plausible reason
given for every suspicious appearance, whether it be a
sightless eye or a pair of broken knees.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Blinkers.</span>—I greatly disapprove of these for breaking.
Let the colt or horse see what you are doing. In
this I am aware that many disagree with me, but I usually
hold to my opinions, as I do not form them in a hurry.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Amateur Blacksmiths.</span>—If you want to be independent
of the forge when frost sets in, you can do it in
this way. As soon as the hunting season has fairly
begun, have your horse’s shoes made with square holes
punched at the extremities and at the toes. Have these
fitted with slightly tapering plugs of steel, with sharp projecting
points. The plugs should be about two inches in
length, and must be made to fit the holes both accurately
and tightly, but not to go quite through the shoe to the
foot. When frost appears, and you want to go out, insert the
plugs <em>yourself</em> in the holes, tap them slightly on the points
<a id="Page_323" href="#Page_323" class="pagenum" title="323"> </a>
with a hammer, and when the horse puts his weight on
them it will drive them “home.” The plugs will last for
three or four days, and are both cheap and easily renewed.
When you require to take them out, another quiet tap or
two (delivered a little at the side) will start them, owing to
the taper on the part that fits into the shoe.</p>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Hot Fitting.</span>”—I entirely approve of this, when
properly conducted. It would need a very lengthy application
of a hot shoe to affect the hoof to any depth—quite
four minutes to cause a marked increase of temperature
in the upper part of the foot—while, in reality, the hot
shoe is not usually applied for more than three or four
seconds.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Temperature of Stables.</span>—The average temperature
of a stable should be about 48°&nbsp;F. Never clip until the
whole of the winter coat has appeared—then do it once for
the entire season. Leaving the saddle-place unclipped will
be more likely to provoke galls than to prevent them.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Supply of Hay.</span>—Six pounds of hay <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per diem</i> is quite
sufficient for a horse, when plenty of other food is given.
Too much hay is a mistake.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Quartern.</span>—Everybody knows that this weighs 2½ lbs.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Stable Forks.</span>—Do away with steel, and use wooden
ones.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Shoes.</span>—A set ought to last four weeks, unless the work
be constant and the going very hard.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Hunting Scarlet.</span>—Do not don red in the hunting
<a id="Page_324" href="#Page_324" class="pagenum" title="324"> </a>
field until your “salad” days are over. It is a remarkable
colour, and of late many excellent sportsmen have discarded
it altogether. This may, perhaps, be owing to the fact that
ladies are putting it on! Two fair Dianas who ride very
straight with the Meath hounds adopted scarlet last
season, and doubtless many more will ere long follow
suit. It is not to be admired, in my opinion, and can
scarcely fail to remind the beholder of things usually
associated with street-organs and itinerant grinders of
these instruments!</p>


<p><span class="smcap">“Unknowing” Ones.</span>—Ignorance concerning horsey
subjects is quite common among ladies who are otherwise
well educated, and, indeed, highly informed. Mrs. Beecher
Stowe relates of herself, in her ‘Sunny Memories,’ that
when dining one day with Earl Russell she spoke of hunting
as “a vestige of the savage state,” when, to her great astonishment,
she saw laughter on all the men’s faces. No
wonder. Fox hunting, or rather riding to hounds is an art
not yet a century old. Two of our most popular authoresses—I
might, perhaps, say the two most popular—make
such egregious mistakes on the subjects of hunting, racing
and betting, that men laugh, and women who know, say,
“What a pity it is!”</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Hunting Centres.</span>—A young Londoner cannot do
better than try his hand with the Surrey Foxhounds, or
with one of the Kentish packs. The hills of Surrey afford
good hunting ground, despite the flints, and the superfluity
of coverts.</p>
<a id="Page_325" href="#Page_325" class="pagenum" title="325"> </a>


<p><span class="smcap">When a Horse is Collar-shy</span>, or nervous about the
adjustment of the crupper, have the latter made to unbuckle,
and procure a collar that opens at the top. This is, of
course, in case of being unable to reassure the animal by
kindness. Put beating and scolding entirely aside; they
have probably led to the evils that have to be cured.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Foot “Home” in the Stirrup</span> was for long a
favourite theory of mine, and one which I myself practised—especially
when travelling long distances, or going the
pace,—but then, I always rode in a plain little racing
stirrup, made sufficiently wide to enable the foot to work
easily in it, so that there was no possibility of its “sticking,”
or proving otherwise dangerous. Finding, however, that,
despite repeated warnings, ladies would persist in adopting
the various forms of so-called safety-stirrups, in which the
foot was absolutely embedded, the stuffing over the instep
helping to tighten the hold, I thought it safest and most
conscientious to discard my theory altogether and advocate
riding from the ball of the foot. To keep perpetually
saying, “Do as I do,” partakes rather of the egotistical and
self-sufficient, even where one may fairly add, “And no
harm will ensue,”—but if, added to this, there is apparently
a strong desire on the part of those spoken to to have
their own way, it is surely wise to offer them such directions
as will best obviate the chances of mishap. Here,
for instance, is an example of my meaning: Suppose that I
am in the habit of reading in bed, using a safety-lamp for
doing so, and I discover that it is a practice in my household
<a id="Page_326" href="#Page_326" class="pagenum" title="326"> </a>
and elsewhere for others to read by the light of a half-burnt
candle, insecurely fastened into its socket in the
candlestick, and laid perhaps upon the pillow,—will it not
be better and safer for me to decry altogether the practice
of night reading, than to keep perpetually urging (without
hope of success) that safety-lamps ought in all cases to
be adopted?</p>


<p><span class="smcap">When a Carriage is kept covered</span> in a coach-house,
the cover ought to be constantly aired.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Never permit Water to Dry</span> of itself on a vehicle, or
it will certainly leave stains.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Aprons</span>, <span class="smcap">Heads</span>, etc., that are composed of enamelled
leather, should be washed with soap and water, and rubbed
well with linseed oil—the former being constantly unfolded,
and the latter kept fully stretched.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Moths</span> can be prevented from settling in the linings of
vehicles by mixing camphor and turpentine in a saucer,
and placing it inside, with all the windows drawn up. The
evaporation of the mixture will serve the purpose well.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Bolts and Clips</span> of vehicles should be constantly looked
to, and tightened if loose; and all repairs should be done
at <em>once</em>, nothing being allowed to lie over.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Horse-collars</span> should be so made that the weight
attached to the traces shall be distributed over the surface
of the shoulders when pulling, not concentrated on one
point, or, almost as bad, perpetually rubbing up and down.
A collar cannot be considered fitted, simply because it
<a id="Page_327" href="#Page_327" class="pagenum" title="327"> </a>
appears all right when the horse is standing still. Set him
going at a good pace, and then judge of it. If he be a high-crested
animal, he will probably need a collar quite two
inches longer than seemed necessary when he stood at
ease. If the traces are attached too low to the hames, they
will draw the collar away from the upper part of the
shoulder. This can only be remedied by shifting the point
of the draught, till a proper bearing has been obtained.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Bencraft Hames.</span>—There is sometimes immense difficulty
in fitting horses that are peculiarly shaped with
collars that will not gall them; in such cases the above
may be tried, as by using them the draught can be shifted
to suit the shoulders or the height of the wheels. They
have an awkward appearance, but nevertheless serve their
purpose admirably.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Shaft-tugs</span> should be of a length to suspend the shafts
at exactly the correct height, by which I mean the centre of
the swell of the pad-flaps, measured both ways. When the
shafts are much bent, the tugs must be shorter than if
ordinarily straight. The traces must be of proper length,
otherwise the correct horizontal position of the shaft-tugs
cannot possibly be maintained. When too short the motion
of the horse forces tugs and pad forward, thus drawing the
crupper uncomfortably tight—and when too long, the
vehicle is drawn by the tugs instead of by the traces. It is
rare to sit behind a horse that one can pronounce properly
harnessed in every particular.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">A Kicking-strap</span> will be worse than useless—it will
<a id="Page_328" href="#Page_328" class="pagenum" title="328"> </a>
chafe and irritate—unless properly put on. A strap that is
either too light or the reverse, or that passes in a direct
line from shaft to shaft, had better not be used at all. It
ought to be just loose enough, nothing more, to allow of
the horse travelling without feeling chafed by it, and should
be fastened at least two inches behind the hip-bones, as a
loin-strap would be.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Fitting the Bit to the Horse’s Mouth.</span>—This,
as I have already stated, is an advisable plan. A Buxton
or Liverpool bit is commonly employed in harness, but
if a horse has a light mouth, he may travel well in a
snaffle. Buxton bits are made without ports. Experience
will tell whether the reins ought to be buckled to the
cheek or to the bars. In my opinion, almost all horses
go well in properly <em>fitting</em> bits. I altogether disapprove
of the enormous affairs with cheeks eleven inches
long, and weighing quite two pounds, which ignorance
sometimes makes use of. I believe that comparatively few
animals require bits of larger dimensions than one and
three-quarter inches for the upper cheek, and three and a-half
for the lower. This latter ought <em>never</em> to be more
than double the length of the upper portion. Even when
the reins are fastened to a ring below the cheek, the weight
of the projecting arm will effect the leverage of the entire
affair.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Horses addicted to Running away</span> frequently lay
hold of the cheek of the bit; it is a fault in large measure
cultivated by using bits that are too broad for the mouth.
<a id="Page_329" href="#Page_329" class="pagenum" title="329"> </a>
To avoid it, the cheeks might be bent backwards, after the
Wimbush pattern.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Correct Bitting</span> gives control in harness without inflicting
pain. Any suffering that cannot be got rid of by the
horse dropping his head to the right position, is barbarous
cruelty, however it may be glossed over or concealed. Half
the horses that one sees in London and elsewhere, poking
their chins in an unnatural manner, are made to do so
by the use of powerful bits and severe curb-chains—yet
ignorance cannot be brought to see it, although the evils
of it are frequently and earnestly set forth.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Blinkers</span> are generally considered indispensable adjuncts
to harness. Why, I do not know.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Bearing-reins</span> are only tolerable when the snaffle bit is
suffered to hang well below the corners of the mouth, and
when the reins themselves are of such a length that the
instant the horse lifts his head and sets off, they become
amply slack. I cannot at all see why they should be
thought an absolute necessity for draught purposes, when
not used in the saddle. There are, of course, cases in which
they are advisable; when, for instance, extremely nervous
or badly-broken animals are of necessity driven through
crowded thoroughfares; but otherwise I cannot believe
that they are either necessary or ornamental.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Fashionable Coachmen</span> concoct an instrument of
torture by drawing up the gag-bit until the horse’s mouth
is dragged back quite two inches: a curb much too
long and very much too wide being next added, and
<a id="Page_330" href="#Page_330" class="pagenum" title="330"> </a>
strained up to the last extremity of tightness. The cruelty
of ordinary bearing-reins is unspeakably great, and to
the use of them may be attributed the loss of sight in
many fine young horses—undue pressure on the glands that
lie just under the angles of the jaws being the fruitful cause
of this melancholy evil.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Nagging</span> at a horse’s mouth when driving him is a most
objectionable practice, and one that is, unfortunately, too
generally indulged in. If an animal appears sluggish, the
driver finds it easier to rouse him temporarily by means of
chucking at his mouth, than by either a suitable use of the
whip, or an investigation into the general state of his
health: a low or disordered condition of which is far more
frequently the cause of sluggishness than the “roguishness,”
of which helpless animals are often wrongfully accused.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">In Driving a Pair</span> the arrangement of the coupling-reins
is a matter of vast importance; for, should one horse
be naturally faster in pace than his fellow, the whole comfort
of the drive will depend upon being able to regulate
the two animals to the same rate of going. To do this the
coupling-rein of the fast horse must be shortened by bringing
the buckle closer to the driver’s hands, so that a pull
will act on him before checking in any degree the speed of
the other horse. Coupling-reins should come to within six
inches of the driver’s fingers. I have seen a pair of runaways
stopped in a short time by laying a firm hold upon
the two <em>inside</em> reins, and dropping the outer ones.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Cantering in Harness</span> is a very common fault, and can
<a id="Page_331" href="#Page_331" class="pagenum" title="331"> </a>
only be stopped by pulling up and starting afresh at a trot.
A canterer in double harness may be controlled by putting
on him a pair of single harness-reins, as well as the double
ones.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Tandem.</span>—I am not an admirer of tandem, but it is a
good way of exercising saddle-horses in the summer time,
and keeping them in condition. They should be always
placed as leaders. Steady, powerful harness horses will be
best to use as wheelers, the comfort and safety of the driver
being dependent upon their paces and behaviour. A leader
should be full of courage, and go always in the collar and
up to the bit. An improvement that I have been told of
for tandem-harness is to have three bars fastened to the
shafts: an effectual means of preventing the leader from
stepping over the traces.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Position when Driving.</span>—I strongly object to the
standing position—as though merely leaning against the
box-seat of the vehicle—which many gentlemen-drivers
adopt. I believe that such an attitude <em>must</em> leave the
driver almost powerless to assist or resist his horses. The
position when driving should be firm, upright, and decided;
the elbows hanging at ease, close to the hips, but not laid
against them; the arms nicely rounded, and the hands held
at a moderate distance from the body. Nothing can be
worse than seeing the arms of the driver dragged forward
by the action of the horses that he is meant to control;
nor can anything be much more objectionable than flinging
up the wrists when coming to a stop, instead of shortening
<a id="Page_332" href="#Page_332" class="pagenum" title="332"> </a>
the reins by passing the right hand quietly in front of the
left.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Really First-class Drivers</span> rarely trust to holding
the reins in one hand only, even in single harness; or, if
they seem to do so, the right hand is ever ready to be laid
upon the off or right hand rein, while the forefinger falls
naturally upon the near one; by this means a gentle
pressure can be exercised either by it or by the exterior
angle of the hand which rests upon the off leather. A good
coachman will always at starting take the reins in both
hands; and animals ought to be trained to start slowly and
collectedly—not with anything that resembles a jerk. The
“show” in which some drivers delight to indulge, both at
starting and when the horses are at rest, by first flicking
them with the whip and then pulling them sharply up, cannot
be too strongly deprecated.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Whip</span>, although esteemed a necessary adjunct to
driving apparatus, should be used as sparingly as possible—more,
in fact, as an instructor, than as a means of inflicting
punishment. There is nothing nicer in driving than seeing
the whip in rest, and the horses, fearless of its severities,
going gaily up to their bridles, restrained by a master hand.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">To be able to drive a Team</span> is not considered a great
feat by many men, or, indeed, by some women, in these
latter days; but of course there is driving and driving—both
of different sorts. I approve of studying under a
first-class wagoner, and being guided <em>entirely</em> by him. To
be a good four-in-hand driver requires courage, coolness
<a id="Page_333" href="#Page_333" class="pagenum" title="333"> </a>
temper, decision, quickness, strength and clearness of sight,
flexible hands, and good staying power in the arms and
back. I have seen but one woman in my life who was able
to drive a team of full-sized horses in best English style;
and I can only recall the names of seven or eight men who
could do so. Hundreds, of course, attempt it, and satisfy
themselves that they are doing splendidly; whereas, the
contrary is, as a rule, the case. Team-driving is not
suitable work for ladies. The mere exertion of holding
four free-going horses for even an hour at a stretch is
so great that, unless the muscles of the arms have been
strengthened by sculling, practising with dumb-bells, or
other gymnastic exercises, the driver will be thoroughly
done up, and at the mercy of any mischance that may
occur, before half the journey has been got over. A strong,
firm-handed, full-muscled man, with a cool nerve, a quick
eye, and his heart in the work he is engaged at, will make
the best driver of a dashing four-in-hand. The “golden
youth” who stand bolt upright against sloping cushions,
curling and uncurling their whips, touching up leaders
that need no touching, or letting them get out of hand—and
double-thonging steady-working wheelers, are simply
objects to laugh at, or to pity, or both.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">To wield the Whip</span> in a workman-like manner may
be practised without horses, by sitting at ease on an
elevation, with a good instructor close at hand. There are
correct uses for every part of it, down to the very point:
a proper position for the stick, and proper ways of using it
<a id="Page_334" href="#Page_334" class="pagenum" title="334"> </a>
at various lengths—all of which have to be learned; and
nobody can be called a coachman who is not intimately
familiar with them—so much so that he can carry his whip
without apparently thinking about it, and hold it, use it,
and curl it, as if by a kind of instinct—precisely as all
these ought to be done.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">A Team should be trained to Stand</span> perfectly still
until the driver gives the word to go. A restless, uneasy,
shuffling, while the apron is being adjusted, the whip taken
up, and the reins gathered, is both unsightly and unpleasant.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Wheelers</span> in a four-in-hand coach ought to start it
and turn it round, without the leaders ever feeling the
traces; and they ought to stop the vehicle with the traces
of the leaders resting quite slack.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">A good Driver</span> will have his leaders so in hand at the
start that when they move they will be out of the collars,
and entirely clear of the splinter-bars.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Practice</span> should be on level ground, and on roads devoid
of traffic. None save really first-class drivers ought ever
attempt to pilot a coach through a crowded thoroughfare.
Plenty of novices do it, and delude themselves with the
notion that they are driving beautifully, when in reality
they are only clearing the road—for, as a rule, people
leave a passage for a four-horsed coach, chiefly I fancy
through fear of being run down by it if they don’t speedily
get out of its way.</p>
<a id="Page_335" href="#Page_335" class="pagenum" title="335"> </a>


<p><span class="smcap">Driving a Team</span> is, on the whole, very far from child’s
play, and it needs a smart wagoner to know and carry
out all the nice points of the art: how, for instance, to make
the wheelers work, when to put on the drags, when to run
down without them, how to regulate the pace, especially
when descending a steep decline, how to go nicely and collectedly
over the tops of all hills, whether great or small,
with numerous other minor matters, which study and
practice can alone teach.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Fourteen miles an hour</span> is a tremendously fast pace
for leaders to trot. Such a rate of going would necessitate
that the wheelers should gallop. Speed is, I always think,
far less necessary than stamina in a four-in-hand team.
A well made up quartett, of which every horse has two
good ends, ought to travel from London to Epsom at a
fair steady pace, and come back in the evening in spanking
style.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">A Team that will Trot</span> briskly up the hill to the
Star and Garter at Richmond at the rate of, say, eight
miles an hour without the whip, may be pronounced a real
good thing.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">If Four Horses</span> cannot be matched in height, I
advocate conceding the difference to the wheelers. Age
will not matter very much—nor will colour—for merely
useful work; but go and action are all important.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">A Good and humane Driver</span> always looks to the condition
of each horse separately, when halting after a long
<a id="Page_336" href="#Page_336" class="pagenum" title="336"> </a>
drive. An oatmeal drink with the chill taken off, and an
abundance of water splashed about the legs, prove great
refreshers. Exhausted horses are immensely benefited by
getting a scrape down, together with a “pick-me-up” of
warm ale.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">An Upper Jaw Bit</span>, and an Over Draw Check will
teach a youngster (when training for harness) almost as
much sense as he will learn by two months’ handling. The
apparatus sobers him—stops that peculiar, one-sided,
<em>twisting</em> kind of kick, or “lurch,” which beginners when
fresh are wont to indulge in—and, in short, teaches him to
trot his level best, without the aid of a kicking-strap. It
is called the “Carleton” Check—I presume from its inventor’s
name—and consists of a very small bar snaffle,
not much thicker than an ordinary lead pencil, with a loose
ring at either end. Straps, about half an inch wide, are
buckled to these rings, and are connected above the
horse’s nostrils by a narrow upper noseband: on the same
principle as an ordinary chin-strap. This little noseband
is necessary to keep the bit called an “upper jaw bit” in
its place: namely, <em>under</em> the <em>upper</em> jaw, just as the regular
bit is <em>upon</em> the <em>under</em> jaw. The little mouthpiece is very
slightly curved—a mere segment of a circle—and from it
the two straps run up the horse’s nose, and are joined
together on his forehead to prevent them chafing his eyes.
They are then continued between the ears, and along
the mane, to the water hook. At the spot where they
pass the headpiece they run through two square loops, in
<a id="Page_337" href="#Page_337" class="pagenum" title="337"> </a>
which are “rolls,” or rollers, to allow the straps free play.
They are joined at the ends, and are made to hook over
the water hook, after which a tiny contrivance is slipped
<em>on</em> the hook, which renders it impossible for the horse (let
him fling his head about as he chooses) to throw the rein
off the hook. The hand, however, can release it in a flash—and
the whole affair is a perfect marvel of neatness and
ingenuity. Its good effects are, to raise the head, extend
the neck, and give free play to the lungs. It likewise
lengthens the gait, steadies the horse, prevents breaking,
obviates “hitching” behind, takes the pull off the driver’s
hands, and brings out a horse’s trot, if he has any at all in
him. The evils are, that it spoils a handsome erect carriage,
lowers the crest, and makes the animal poke his nose in an
unsightly manner. In short, it is invaluable for training
a road horse, or trotter, but the habitual use of it is undesirable
and even cruel, for a horse cannot possibly bend
while he has it on. So rigid are its effects, and so impossible
is it for an animal to lower his head while wearing
it, that I am of opinion it would put an effectual “stopper”
upon the tricks of the most confirmed buck-jumper living,
if connecting-straps were just passed, say, underneath the
saddle, and attached firmly to the crupper. This is merely
an idea,—but I should like to see it tested in a practical
way.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Kemble Jackson</span> is another kind of bit employed
very largely in the States, especially in Kentucky, which
is a very horsey district,—one of the most so, indeed, in
<a id="Page_338" href="#Page_338" class="pagenum" title="338"> </a>
America. The Jackson can be used with or without an
upper jaw bit, and has the reins of the check to run through
loops directly <em>under</em> the ears—where some tandem lines
go. This has the effect of giving a lofty carriage to the
head, without making the horse poke his nose as the
Carleton does. No noseband is employed with it, and the
wearer can hold his head in handsome position—which is
an immense advantage with a carriage horse, in which up-headedness
is an essential attribute. It is in some points
quite before the Carleton, which latter (if constantly used)
imparts absolute rigidity to the muscles of the neck, and
intensifies the evil known as “<em>ewe</em>”-neck; but for helping
the trot, and teaching sense to a youngster, the Carleton
beats anything that I have ever seen.</p>

<p class="title">LAYS OF IND. By <span class="smcap">Aliph Cheem</span>.</p>

<p>COMIC, SATIRICAL, AND DESCRIPTIVE.</p>

<p>Poems Illustrative of Anglo-Indian Life.</p>

<p><i>Seventh Edition. Enlarged. Cloth, gilt.</i> 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“This is a remarkably bright little book. ‘Aliph Cheem,’ supposed to be
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nom-de-plume</i> of an officer in the 18th Hussars, is, after his fashion, an
Indian Bon Gaultier. In a few of the poems the jokes, turning on local names
and customs, are somewhat esoteric; but, taken throughout, the verses are
characterised by high animal spirits, great cleverness, and most excellent
fooling.”—<cite>The World.</cite></p>

<p>“Highly amusing ballads and songs, which have already in a former edition
warmed the hearts and cheered the lonely hours of many an Anglo-Indian,
the pictures being chiefly those of Indian life. There is no mistaking the
humour, and at times, indeed, the fun is both ‘fast and furious.’ Many portions
remind us of the ‘Bab Ballads.’ One can readily imagine the merriment
created round the camp fire by the recitation of ‘The Two Thumpers,’ which
is irresistibly droll.”—<cite>Liverpool Mercury.</cite></p>

<p>“One of the most superb little presentation books we have ever seen.”—<cite>Indian
Mail.</cite></p>

<p>“The ‘Lays’ are not only Anglo-Indian in origin, but out-and-out Anglo-Indian
in subject and colour. To one who knows something of life at an Indian ‘station’
they will be especially amusing. Their exuberant fun at the same time may
well attract the attention of the ill-defined individual known as ‘the general
reader.’”—<cite>Scotsman.</cite></p>

OF THE LONDON MISSIONARY

<p><i>Illustrated by very numerous Engravings

<p>REVIEWS.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“His aim has been to give a faithful account of the Hindoo deities such as
an intelligent native would himself give, and he has endeavoured, in order to
achieve his purpose, to keep his mind free from prejudice or theological bias.
To help to completeness he has included a number of drawings of the principal
deities, executed by native artists. The author has attempted a work of no
little ambition, and has succeeded in his attempt, the volume being one of
great interest and usefulness; and not the less so because he has strictly refrained
from diluting his facts with comments of his own. It has numerous
illustrations.”—<cite>Home News.</cite></p>

<p>“Mr. Wilkins has done his work well, with an honest desire to state facts
apart from all theological prepossession, and his volume is likely to be a
useful book of reference.”—<cite>Guardian.</cite></p>

<p>“In Mr. Wilkins’ book we have an illustrated manual, the study of which
will lay a solid foundation for more advanced knowledge, while it will furnish
those who may have the desire, without having the time or opportunity to go
further into the subject, with a really extensive stock of accurate information.”—<cite>Indian

<p>OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><cite>Saturday Review.</cite>—“The work is written in a clear and practical way.”</p>

<p><cite>The Field.</cite>—“Of the many popular veterinary books which have come
under our notice, this is certainly one of the most scientific and reliable. The
author tells us, in the preface to the first edition, that any merit which the
book may possess is to be ascribed to
the teaching of the Principal and
Professors of the New Veterinary
College at Edinburgh, where he
studied. It is much to be desired
that every student would make so
much use of his opportunities as Capt.
Hayes has done.</p>

<p>“Some notice is accorded to
nearly all the diseases which are
common to horses in this country,
and the writer takes advantage of his
Indian experiences to touch upon
several maladies of horses in that
country, where veterinary surgeons
are few and far between. The description
of symptoms and the directions
for the application of remedies
are given in perfectly plain terms,
which the tyro will find no difficulty
in comprehending; and, for the purpose
of further smoothing his path, a chapter is given on veterinary medicines,
their actions, uses, and doses. This information will be most acceptable to
the majority of horse-owners, and may be invaluable on an emergency when
no advice better than that of the village cow doctor can be obtained.”</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="center">“POGSON’S AGRICULTURE.</div>

to fulfil all the hopes that have been formed
of it. We cannot doubt that the Government
will heartily take up this most valuable book,
and circulate it both in the original and vernacular
translations throughout the length and
breadth of the land; nor should a moment be
lost, for it represents one of the most important
and most promising lines on which we can meet
that terrible Malthusian difficulty.”—<cite>Allen’s
Indian Mail.</cite></p>

<p>“A work of extreme practical value.”—<cite>Home

<p>“Mr. Pogson’s advice may be profitably
followed by both native and European agriculturists,
for it is eminently practical and devoid
of empiricism. His little volume embodies the
teaching of a large and varied experience, and deserves to be
warmly supported.”—<cite>Madras Mail.</cite></p>

<p class="title">TALES FROM INDIAN HISTORY:<br />

BEING THE<br />

Annals of India retold in Narratives.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By J. TALBOYS WHEELER.</span></p>

<p class="justify">Forms a complete History of India from the earliest period to the present
day, drawn up as a series of “Narratives” for general reading in schools and
families. So far it will resemble the history of Scotland as told in Sir Walter
Scott’s “Tales of a Grandfather,” omitting all details and disquisitions which
are sufficiently given in the author’s larger histories of India, and seeking to
tell the progress of events in the most simple and attractive manner.</p>

<p class="title">Reviews of Wheeler’s ‘Tales from Indian History.’</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“While the work has been written for them (natives), it has also been
written for the people of England, who will find in the volume, perhaps for
the first time, the history of our great dependency made extremely attractive
reading. Mr. Wheeler’s narrative is written in a most graceful style; indeed,
he is master of the English language. He does not confine himself to the
mere dry details of history, but tells the adventures of Indian heroes and
heroines in legends of love and war; describes the village communities of
India, their organization and self-government; delineates the results of caste,
infant marriage, and other Hindoo institutions and usages as seen in the family
and social life of the people in villages and towns, as well as in courts and
palaces.... The work also contains valuable observations on the foreign
relations of the Indian Empire with Persia, Russia, Turkey, and China.
Altogether this is a work of rare merit.”—<cite>Broad Arrow.</cite></p>

<p>“In going through an interesting book, the reader will be furnished with
a good general notion of Indian history, and learn besides something about
Indian modes of life.”—<cite>Queen.</cite></p>

<p>“Will absorb the attention of all who delight in thrilling records of
adventure and daring. It is no mere compilation, but an earnest and brightly-written
book.”—<cite>Daily Chronicle.</cite></p>

<p>“This little volume contains a history of India in the form of tales and
narratives, intended by the author for the people of India as well as for those
of the British Isles.”—<cite>Army and Navy Gazette.</cite></p>

<p>“No young reader who revolts at the ordinary history presented to him in
his school books will hesitate to take up this. No one can read a volume such
as this without being deeply interested.”—<cite>Scotsman.</cite></p>

<p class="title">THE

MANAGEMENT AND MEDICAL TREATMENT

OF

CHILDREN IN INDIA.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By EDWARD A. BIRCH, M.D.</span>,<br />

<i>Surgeon-Major Bengal Establishment</i>.</p>

<p>Second Edition; being the Eighth Edition of <span class="smcap">Goodeve’s</span> “Hints on the
Management of Children in India.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p><cite>Dr. Goodeve.</cite>—“I have no hesitation in saying that the present edition is for many reasons
superior to its predecessors. It is written very carefully, and with much knowledge and experience
on the author’s part, whilst it possesses the great advantage of bringing up the
subject to the present level of Medical Science.”</p>

<p><cite>The Medical Times and Gazette</cite>, in an article upon this work and Moore’s “Family
Medicine for India,” says:—“New editions of these two well-known works have recently
appeared. They are both intended to supply in some measure the medical wants of our
numerous countrymen in India, who may be either far from professional help in emergencies
of sickness or of accident, or destitute of medical advice regarding the proper
management of their own health, and especially that of their children, in the trying climate
of Hindostan. Although we are, as a rule, very much opposed to popular medical instruction,
believing that the result is most frequently a minimum of serviceable knowledge
along with a vast preponderance of what is but partial, misleading, and dangerous, yet
the peculiar circumstances of many of our countrymen in India, together with the
special and insidious dangers of its varying climate, fully justify the publication of a
few trustworthy popular works to warn the unwary new-comer, before it be too late,
of the dangers he has to encounter, and to give judicious counsel to solitary individuals
and families who cannot enjoy the advantages of personal professional advice. Moreover,
the two works before us are in themselves probably about the best examples of
medical works written for non-professional readers. The style of each is simple, and as free
as possible from technical expressions. The modes of treatment recommended are generally
those most likely to yield good results in the hands of laymen; and throughout each volume
the important fact is kept constantly before the mind of the reader, that the volume he is
using is but a poor substitute for personal professional advice, for which it must be discarded
whenever there is the opportunity. Written with such objects, and in such a spirit, these
volumes cannot fail to be of the greatest service; and that they are appreciated is shown by
the rapid appearance of successive editions, the second mentioned and elder treatise having
now reached the seventh edition. We would add, that although they are specially written
for lay readers, there are few young medical officers proceeding to India who would not
receive several useful hints from these unpretentious volumes. But it is to parents or to
the guardians of European children in India that they must be of pre-eminent service.”</p>

<p class="title">THACKER’S

INDIAN DIRECTORY

EMBRACING<br />

The whole of India and Burmah.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="center">THE “TIMES.”</div>

<p>“The fact that this work, originally known as the ‘Directory of Bengal,’ has now
reached its 24th annual issue, is sufficient to recommend it to all those who are brought into
contact, in a military, civil, or commercial sense, with the civilization and intelligence of our
Eastern dependencies. No longer confined to the narrow limits of Bengal, Messrs. Thacker
furnish us with complete and detailed information respecting not only Calcutta, but also the
citizens of Bombay and Madras. The parts which relate to the yearly almanac, public
holidays, stamps, telegraphs, and customs are pretty much one and the same; but in most
other matters we have before us separate and distinct information as to the various departments
of Government and the arrangements of commerce, education, charitable societies and
hospitals, clubs, railways, and companies. There is also a separate Army list, we note, for
each of the three Presidencies. The alphabetical list of residents, comprising as it does a
full record of all those of our countrymen who have taken up their permanent abodes in any
of the Indian Presidencies, will be found of the greatest use to those in England who have
lost all clue to their relatives and friends in the far East and wish to discover their whereabouts.”—Aug.
28, 1886.</p>

<div class="center">THE CALCUTTA “ENGLISHMAN.”</div>

<p>“Before everything, the volume before us is in reality what it professes to be—a
Directory for India. Besides an enormous mass of information of the purely Directory
kind, which must have taken a world of labour to collect and collate, the volume comprises
complete Army Lists for Bengal, Madras, and Bombay, including the Volunteers; lists of
officers in the various Government Departments; lists of the Tea, Indigo, Coffee, and other
estates in the country; and much valuable information regarding the Telegraphs, Postal
Rules, Law Courts, Charities, and a host of other subjects. Nothing more strikingly represents
the change that has come over India in recent years than this great Directory.”</p>

<div class="center">THE “MANCHESTER GUARDIAN.”</div>

<p>“The Directory now includes every district and principal town in British and Foreign
India, every Native State, and in fact aims at being a directory to the whole of India. It
contains separate classified and street directories of each of the cities of Calcutta, Bombay,
and Madras, a remarkably comprehensive and detailed Mofussil Directory, and a vast
amount of general information relating to India, its Government, commerce, postal arrangements,
festivals, and official establishments.... The expansion of the work will be
welcomed as a response to the growing requirements of commerce with India.”</p>
